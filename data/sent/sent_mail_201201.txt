Illhave to defer to Gene on this. It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the
appointment ofiuwaili as Minister of Defense Juwaili is close to the UAE, incidentally). But I simply do not know the
ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits
seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported "loosely" to BelHaj I don't
believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former).
The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may
remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.
Gene?
