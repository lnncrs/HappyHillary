Obama was too cautious in fearful times
By Martin Wolf
Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48
Suppose that the US presidential election of 1932 had, in fact, taken place in 1930, at an early stage in the Great
Depression. Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. How
different subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment
collapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.
On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close
to the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas,
it was not. I noted on February 4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: "Instead of an overwhelming fiscal
stimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused." A week later, I asked: "Has Barack Obama's
presidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are
times of great danger. Today, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will own
it. Today, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow,
events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much." This was right.
The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.
Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of the
financial sector.
But, as Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, had said: "When markets overshoot, policymakers must
overshoot too". Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claim
that policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.
In consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have
disappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy
joblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction.
True, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one
were far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the
Fed, and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model to
assess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)
and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been
close to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, the
unemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also
have meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response
but no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round.
The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread over
several years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it argues
that in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and
1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package.
Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish
there were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowing
the collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal
deficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.
A fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. The
recession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionally
large, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen to
output and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the
stimulus.
Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, since
fiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy success. At the same time, the
enthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse in
construction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for
managers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.
Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, is
that one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that from
happening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat of
inflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and
fiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and
the administration has lost the initiative.
So what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and
ignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the same
thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It would
have to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them, so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their
"yacht and mansion-led" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Those
who were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.

What Created the Populist Explosion and How
Democrats Can Avoid the Shrapnel in
November
To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The only question at this point is how to mitigate the
damage when the bomb detonates in November.

To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile
mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to
mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.
The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what
the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep
Americans employed. The "Obama Doctrine" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to
contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the
demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and
schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global
economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to
taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30
points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, "We don't have a
shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work." That message resonates across the political
spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest
deficit-cutting language the other side can muster.
But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This
Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come
down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures
whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children
are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who
did are once again making out like bandits.
Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting
themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle
America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they
understand the public mood and speak to it.
What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.
On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at
what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the
vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their
children's future.
How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts
So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.
Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and
Reconciliation without the Truth Part
• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.
By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening
to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.
• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout
with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say "no" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession
turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these
are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy
of Republican ideology.
• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are
frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to "government is the problem, not the
solution" and a path back to economic recovery and security.
• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.
• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that
we should "look forward, not backward," even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As
conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or
President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five
either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who
gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to
repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't
subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -
- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his
first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,
to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if
forced to, he would cite unnamed "naysayers," "Washington politics as usual," or "Congress," which was
counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this
messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:
• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential
when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best
educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but
never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked
him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office
because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice
except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).
A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but
appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.
• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his
party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding
by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.
• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-
Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.
But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to
stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what
they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the
Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and
warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be
needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start
returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the
president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of
voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point
for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.
• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of
dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that
this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new "stimulus" act will do
cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and
no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never
adequately crafted or sold.
• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the
future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the
excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new
president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the
Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president
nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that
received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but
don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,
the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit
card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.
• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even
investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.
Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan
• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,
and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the
same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1
margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,
as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for
opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.
• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising
any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to "sell" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about
this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to
state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we
should have a "public option" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine
the support it might have received if it had been called instead "the one health care plan the health insurance
companies don't get to control"). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as "bending the cost curve" while
conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as "government takeover," "a bureaucrat between
you and your doctor," and "death panels."
• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would
explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without
protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.
• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for
seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social
Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the "serial bribery" of
Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.
• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like
alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of
even swing voters wanting it included in the bill.
• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that
government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the
better plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are "Cadillacs" that are going to be
taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything
right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record
supporting government or spending.
• "Government" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.
• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval
with swing voters drops into the high thirties.
• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that
when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to "reassure"
the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that
reassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues
needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive
positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)
• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly
confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The
president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families
tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;
pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and "clean coal" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a
speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for
passing "No Latino Left Behind," while publicly objecting to the legislation.
• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal
parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and
incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center
desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both
FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.
But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and
betrayed (if they're part of the "professional left") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow
politics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).
• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the "drill here, drill now," "all
of the above" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect
opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,
the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans
against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what
happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)
and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself
on the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control
information for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear
indistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.
Where Do We Go from Here?
So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to
vote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and
a vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren't
going well.
In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats
might lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American
public knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the
American people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both
houses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was
necessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.
But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the
new administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.
Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's), and it's not one that supports a
progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the
public to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throw
another one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White
House hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and
when he does, he does them well.
The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the
game. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk
about deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if
Democrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,
and speak to people's worries and 'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their
opponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and
fiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate
conservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on
issue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans
and small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.
But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we
should have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -
- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of
work by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular
aid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police
all over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out of
the bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against
them, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this
country, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid
paying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a
reasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass the
first badly need "fix" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this
was just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while
cutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so
essential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to
prevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's not
too late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the
voice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.
On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need
to play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,
knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative
from what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- "the Republicans won't let us do it" -- to a
narrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between
two well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.
That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and
who led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That
narrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a
seemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key
elements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street
is gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent
aboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,
then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from
competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional
investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe
fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.
That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?
Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for
peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi
Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called "peace process." And if that one step forward in Oslo in
1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs
the world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by
degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It
stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the
interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is
increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this
contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in
the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle
East thus affect much more than that region.
Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve
parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional
support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a "peace
process" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are
alternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for
powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.
Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadat
had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian
leaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other
governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of
any other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.
For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and
to sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of
international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American
support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the
Palestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought
successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.
Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political
framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic
cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive
confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.
Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine
remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the
region — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for
conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,
India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has
postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.
On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel
with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.
subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude
arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt
of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have
timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American
protection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and
citizens.
Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody
righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standards
generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments
associated with it.
The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American
complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protection
of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attack
included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and
Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The
armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other
countries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are
echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,
The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a
metastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a
menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European
xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers
terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted
demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent
illustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It
rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.
President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into
office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international
media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish
parliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably
eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices
in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious
recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy
change anyone can detect, let alone believe in
It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration's
stewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two
months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is
only part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in
the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.
Let me begin with the "peace process," a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the Obama
Administration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and "even-
handed" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It
provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to
stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the
Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there
hasn't been an American-led "peace process" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a "peace
process" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the "peace
process" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.
Even when there was no "peace process," the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the
guileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far
from least — lifetime employment for career "peace processors." The perpetual processing of peace without the
requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like
magicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their
homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening
swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.
Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a "peace process." It's
not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing "peace process" charades
justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied
territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American
leaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East "peace process" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic
worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are
impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the
government of Israel to trade land for it.
Previous "peace processes" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have
served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving
it. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of
relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as
they first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington
tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed
"peace processes" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-
prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political
authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President
Obama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still
less to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final
— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual "peace process" are more fundamental.
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates
that: "The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign
state." This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has
no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound
by the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the "Roadmap," or the premise of the "two-state
solution."
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the
authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their
standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its
authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains
power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered
by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over
a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his
administration can now speak.
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with
the mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international
credibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,
and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was
publicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's
continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the "peace process" has always
sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year
was made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted
from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will
recall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the
international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian
state. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to
impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality
directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these
absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas
— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were
explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly
finessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile
either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be
represented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks
tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest
installment of the "peace process" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and
also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the
United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition
evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and
Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new "peace process" have officially acknowledged or
responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,
ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's "right to exist" the central purpose of the "peace process" offends
Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem
to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and
the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and
accept peace?
Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a
homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of
Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking
them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they
recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral
expansion at Palestinian expense.
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns
about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.
peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of
acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with
incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement
of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a "peace process" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of
carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously
unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of
George Mitchell's mandate for "peace process" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed
follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other
Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic
has two quite different words that are both translated as "negotiation," making a distinction that doesn't exist in either
English or Hebrew. One word, "musaawama," refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, "mufaawadhat," describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that
take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with
intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on
which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic
effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the
reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand
how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are
long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential
militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have
forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.
I am not myself an "Arabist," but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the
American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and
empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw
as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our
Middle East diplomacy.
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for
what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed
Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -
but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross
injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as
friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of
anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to
the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.
Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination
for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest
in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions
with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as
they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue
and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long
transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all
sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of
religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure
freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest
that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is
generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects
pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting
may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the
achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's that
others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not
expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was
happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected
from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.
This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most
Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending
the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to
present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the
Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint
or parallel action on behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted
than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its
contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab
League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the
Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation
with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab
Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations with
both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a
well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who
are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so
as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace
partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has
acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity
government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong
domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.
Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law
internationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system has
served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented
the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights
conventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the
collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied
territory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,
barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,
usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.
If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just "unhelpful" but illegal, the international community should
find a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -
its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt
themselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both
as occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General
Assembly cannot "unite for peace" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink
from working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond
need to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better
chance for peace.
Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN
Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference
outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in
a year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference
would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967
borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring
Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the
consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the
international community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic
confrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-
year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement
activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel's
actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are
determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to
alleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage
against injustice that incites terrorism.
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation
between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked
to set the stage for a discussion of this issue.

Joint Interview
MS —
Jake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things that
he was not in a position to share:
1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at great
cost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.
2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping its
unprecedented nature
3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
So three points:
1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will be
taken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, and
canceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israeli
media, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be,
we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.
Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. I
understand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesn't mean you have to
and second, you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to say
about them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could have
foreseen before going so far down the road, and should have - which I don't think is fair or reflects well on you.
Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and
exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than
tomorrow's relative short and peaceful format.
If you'd like to discuss I'm at my desk and available or can call you through Ops.

Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP
Newcomers for Congress
Three in four believe influx of new members would improve
Congress
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of
four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer "a
Republican who has not served in Congress." Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over
a newcomer.
These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for
Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican
candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless
of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.
The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters
want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington
experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type
of experienced representatives now in Congress.
One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican
candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus
challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,
more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in
Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one
who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.
The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific
candidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic
candidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the
Republican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans
say the Republican and 43% the Democrat.
The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress
would be changed for the better if "most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members." Only 14%
think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong
anti-incumbent sentiment.
Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members
were turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of
Democrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from
Democrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.
Implications
In a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and
Congress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in
Americans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in
this fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater
seat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.

I read the Roger Cohen piece and agree that it is v smart. And I've been thinking about the need for a headline/bumper
sticker for the speech. How about "A New American Century"? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and
make the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).
1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require
bringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the
only option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a
profile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)
2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought
together that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations
are sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for
mobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our
history and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a
world of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.
3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,
optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on
development as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as
governments. This is our time.
The speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving
problems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture
of cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.

Americans Give GOP Edge on Most Election
Issues
Greatest Republican advantages on terrorism, immigration,
federal spending
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a better
job than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on
healthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.
The Republicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.
Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have
viewed the Democrats as superior.
A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's elections,
highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current
survey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths
like terrorism and moral values.
With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in
congressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the
2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five
weeks.
The Economy Matters Most
The Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its
2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,
economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along
with government corruption) as extremely important.
The Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federal
spending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as very
important by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list.
Bottom Line
Republicans' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party's advantageous positioning heading
into the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge on
these issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing the
country, or whether the ratings have more to do with the public's frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party's
performance to date.
The Democrats' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-
starting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans' minds. That could be tough to do when, after
nearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House, Americans' opinions of the economy
remain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on "Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world." To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term "radical populism," but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital."
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: "Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy." For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when "Jews apologize for killing Poles."
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking "Jewish
capital" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the "provocateur" taunting
the establishment, the "toreador" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. "She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence," Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. "It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012."
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or "Gypsies"),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. "I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit," she says.
"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father." The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a "sulfurous" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as "neither left nor right." If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's
rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, "tent pis," she says.
Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them
the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out
between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly
Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of
trying to build a new coalition government.
Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual
caricature of "people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan," Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes "the American right
is much more to the right than the National Front." She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers
more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation
to help its people. "We feel the state should have the means to intervene," she says. "We are very attached to public
services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French," including "access for all to
the same level of health care."
Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by
competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the
family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was
brought down. The crime has never been solved. "The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician
sent a word of condolence," she says. "It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you."
That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential
race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

US Election And The Fed
Welcome To The New (Old) World
September 19, 2010
One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more
conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials
on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).
But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and
Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.
Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE
snarkiness) two things should not be lost:
1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda
2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care
legislation Congress pushed through.
All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the
House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of
spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.
Let's start with spending:
The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we
wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us
that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will
be one of the top Republican priorities.
Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do
not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time
money was formally appropriated).
Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has
to pass a "continuing resolution" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made
(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing
resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).
Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new
Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but
that would be cutting it close and too cute.
Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be
dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more
moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and
take the hit.
In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to
slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.
The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules
requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels
you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.
Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal
wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to
see one of those).
The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will
accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike
down parts of the health care bill now under appeal.
THE SENATE
While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on
what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.
The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a
glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health
care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.
The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and
regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier
Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into
office).
While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered
more conservative than their predecessors:
1. ck (CO) - likely winner
2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner
3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner
4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner
5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner
6. Portman (OH) -likely winner
7. Coats (IN) - likely winner
8. Paul (KY) - likely winner
9. Miller (AK) - likely winner
10. Lee (UT) - likely winner
11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner
12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner
13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)
14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup
There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races
continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.
These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:
1. DeMint (SC)
2. Coburn (OK)
3. Inhofe (OK)
4. McConnell (KY)
5. Kyl (AZ)
6. McCain (AZ)
7. Thune (SD)
8. Crapo (ID)
9. Vitter (LA)
10. Burr (NC)
One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a
minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road
blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture
impossible on spending bills.
Welcome to the new reality.

Miserable evening with the Arabs, with all of them reinforcing each other on moratorium walk-out. Euros just as bad.
Fayyad was the only bright light.

Apparently Jeff said evening was horrible. Only AbZ and Kuwaiti showed up from GCC. All formal speeches, little ability
for chit chat. No great mood overall.

Basic principles for NYT ed board:
US principles: gov't should reflect election results; gov't must have significant role for Iraqiyya (good for internal stability
and regional integration); gov't formation should include a strong reform and power-sharing understanding; we want a
gov't as committed to the long-term partnership with us as we are. These are principles backed by all Iraqi leaders, who
need to make decisions now to break the deadlock.
We have no candidate for PM. We have encouraged Allawi's Iraqiyya and Maliki's State of Law to see if they can work
together, because that reflects the votes and would give the new gov't a healthy majority. But who fills what position --
that's for the Iraqis to decide.
There may be other ways to have a gov't. But this should happen soon. Where we would have concerns: if the Sadrists
end up with the power to veto gov't decisions or to topple the gov't.

Without the benefit of seeing the clips yet, I think last night worked well. Pitch perfect, positive in that you wrapped

I actually think there was more interest in whether the Imam was there - as evidence of how much voltage the Mosque
issue still carries. Geoff Earle of the NY Post was there for that reason alone. It's early but my read of the NY Post seems
that their cover is dedicated to KSM losing 40 lbs.

H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid
aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her "new American moment"—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living "a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential." There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that "we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad."
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: "The United States can, must and will lead in the new century." In order to do that, Clinton promised "a
new global architecture," "built to last and withstand stress." And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: "Democracy needs defending."
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow "the rules of the road" in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like "American might," words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's "old-fashioned" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of "American might." The first, of course, is "economic power." But it is her
hailing of the second—America's "moral authority"—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: "The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president." What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

You were great this morning, truly. And your instincts on the speech were just right. I was very proud to be in the front
row. I am also enormously pleased that in the last 2 months we have gotten a major speech and a Foreign Affairs article
done with a lot of people working very well as a team -- exactly as it ought to be. That is a tribute to top-level
management and our ability to learn from experience and make improvements. It's a team I will be all the more sorry to
leave. But now for the QDDR I'll be home for the rest of the week writing hard
file're going to get there -- cheryl taking hold has, as usual, been a huge help.

Post-Daley circus gets started early
Easier to count those who aren't running than those who are
By Rick Pearson, Hal Dardick, Tribune reporters
11:17 PM CDT, September 8,2010
The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began Wednesday with all of the promise of baseball's Opening Day —
no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown.
With Mayor Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb. 22 city election, various
political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders
from the pretenders.
"There will be a lot of candidates," Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would
not seek a seventh term. "Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be
candidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here."
In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen
aldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who
wanted to listen about how they could be the city's next mayor.
But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it's "better to be looked over than
overlooked" — weren't limited to City Hall.
In Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama's political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.
Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts
reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.
"Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide," Mel! said. "It takes a full-
scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote."
Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a "unifier" and
"can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city."
Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.
"I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going
to be fair to the African-American community," said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council's black
caucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall.
"For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to
support them ... Everyone has an opportunity."
At City Hall, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said
it was "critical" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community's
interests. But the council's black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving
education, that prospective candidates should address.
Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential
candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.
"If there's a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote," said Ald. Danny
Solis, 25th.
"I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won't be a Hispanic in the runoff," Solis said.
"But then I think we can play a very important role" in backing one of the remaining candidates.
But such sentiments didn't deter one of the city's most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans
to run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement "down the
road."
Mell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to
reach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters
proceed to an April 5 runoff election.
One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the
campaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be
measured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.
Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to
ensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to
ensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff.
"I'm getting a lot of calls about having lunch," said the committeeman. "I've told them to call me back when
they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising."
Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor
Harold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.
"There's a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I've learned over the years to sit and
listen and see who can put the different coalitions together," said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward's
Democratic committeeman. "Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the
person who is going to win."
While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn't
heard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.
Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he'd like to
be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley's announcement.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel
to "take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future."
But Axelrod, who previously served as Daley's political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided
to leave the White House for a mayoral bid, "the president will support that decision."
Saying mayors are "larger than life personalities," Axelrod said Emanuel "has that combination of skills and
that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route."

Home Minister Appeals to Media to Help Maintain Communal Harmony in View of U.S. Pastor
Threatening to Burn Quran
The Union Home Minister Slui P.Chidambaram has appealed to media to help maintain communal peace and
harmony in the wake of reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the holy Quran. In a
statement issued here today, the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife between
different religious groups. Following is the text of his statement :
"There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11, 2010.
The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the world
have also condemned his proposed action.
We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. It
is obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who is
interested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action.
We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed.
While we await the action of the US authorities, we would appeal to the media in India — both print and
visual media — to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. We
would also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help in
maintaining communal peace and harmony."

India Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran, Urges
Media Restraint
By Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9, 2010
India "condemns" a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. will
take strong action against him, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi.
Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General David
Petraeus, commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the act would endanger U.S. troops.
Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a "deplorable act"
and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the
"next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony," the minister said, reading a
government statement.
The proposed burning "is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion," Chidambaram
said. About 13 percent of India's 1.2 billion people are Muslim.
Facing mounting criticism around the world and at home, Jones said yesterday that supporters have sent him
copies of the Koran to burn and he was not convinced "that backing down is the right thing to do," Associated
Press reported.

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
"We need you to get out there and speak up against this," Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
them out.
As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama
mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,
cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.
The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met "countless times with
special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he "epitomizes the
smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington."
Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically
motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that
he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small
plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.
"I get lobbied every day by somebody," he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. "It could be by my wife. It could be
the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace."
Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt
Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his
reputation as a "Chamber of Commerce" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for
Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.
If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds
coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong
with that.
"Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely," said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm
represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse
as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. "But I think all the good lawmakers do."
Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco
lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had
broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.
His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the
Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's
legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership
position.
But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the
Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,
along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,
write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.
That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a
Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.
The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,
maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.
Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's
political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.
While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate
interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The
members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.
"He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it," said Drew Maloney, a
lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. "That is how you get things done."
One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —
ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil
industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.
But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.
From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by
companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)
In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to
popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been
curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.
Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for
through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz
Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at
the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.
In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-
raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw
large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.
He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the
Republican National Committee.
"The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates," Mr. Boehner told his supporters,
one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. "But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because
we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money."
Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised
nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates
across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.
The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like "meetings with
Leader Boehner and much much more."
But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of
access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.
"He knows this is going to be a tough election," said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients
include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. "But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."

ROBERT GIBBS (*PressSec) tweets on the NYT front-pager on House Republican
Leader John Boehner: "Headline says it all.. .A G.O.P. Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
http://nyti.ms/bxbF4D ... Don't forget this handy clip & save graphic of 'I( Street Cabinet'
(black & white photo doesn't do that tan justice!) http://nyti.ms/9n1wVp"
BOEHNER taped "Face the Nation" yesterday from West Chester, Ohio:
Bob Schieffer: "I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are
willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending
the tax cuts for the upper bracket American."
Rep. Boehner: "Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright? If the only option I
have is to vote for those at 250 and below, of course I'm going to do that. But I'm going to do
everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans."
A Boehner aide reads between the lines: "Despite what Obama says, Republicans are not
holding middle-class tax cuts hostage and we're not going to let him get away with those types of
false claims. Our focus remains on getting bipartisan support for a freeze on all current rates,
because that is what is best for the economy and small business job creation. Boehner's words
were calculated to deprive Obama of the ability to continue making those false claims, and as a
result we are in a better position rhetorically to pressure more Democrats to support a full
freeze."
AN INSTANT CLASSIC:
Schieffer: "Mr. Boehner, I'm going to ask you this question because I'm not objective about this
- I'm a cancer survivor, I used to be a heavy smoker. Do you still smoke?"
Boehner: "I do."
Schieffer: "You have taken $340,000 from the tobacco industry. They've been the largest
contributor to your political campaigns over the year. How do you square that with the fact that
cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in this country, 435,000 people,
their deaths are linked to cancer, that's 1 in 5. How do you justify that in your own mind?"
Boehner:i"Bob, tobacco is a legal product in America. The American people have a right to
decide for themselves whether they want to partake or not. There are lots of things that we deal
with and come in contact with every day, from alcohol to food to cigarettes, a lot of the things
that aren't good for our health. But the American people ought to have the right to make those
decisions on their own." ...
Schleifer: "If you should become Speaker, you could set a good example for the country by
saying, 'I'm going to stop smoking.' Maybe you could get the President, I understand he smokes
too, maybe the two of you could find a way to try to stop smoking. That'd be kind of a good
thing, wouldn't it?"
I Boehner: "Bob, I appreciate your suggestion."

We spoke to the Norway's Ambassador to the UN and they are joining the Alliance for Clean Cookstoves for $600,000
the first year. They noted that this is a down payment and would contribute a "substantial amount for this endeavor" in
the future. They wanted to move quickly for the CGI announcement and ant to see a business plan before they commit
more.
Thnx for making this important call. Other countries including France and Finland were waiting for the Norway signal.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Days of rage: the Tea Party & America's right
Blumenthal begin of the skype highlighting end of the skype highlighting, 17 September 2010

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of "Republican Gomorrah", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
"He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. "These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. "Good luck Obama", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. "We outnumber him 100 to 1." At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay
former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a "left-wing hack" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a "racist". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were "no red states" and no "conservative America". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by "partisans". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could "bridge the partisan divide". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies "fifth columnists" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become "a liberal Reagan who can reunite America". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: "I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views." Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see "Barack Obama, the fallen messiah", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the "Birther" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a "civilian national security force", Taitz told me she "realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany."
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her "greatest supporter", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% "weren't
sure". "Obama should be in the Big House", Taitz shrieked to me, "not the White House!"
When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the "Other", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the "9-12 Project" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. "We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: "Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that."
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party "Patriots" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
"real America". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying "ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters." Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of "Freedom works! Freedom
works!" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party "Patriots" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other "real American"
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.
Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
"catastrophic" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described "hardcore pro-lifer" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of "economic freedom". She claimed the Democratic "cap-
and-trade" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for "socialism" (though she admitted her family "used to hustle over the border" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for "death panels" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's "death panels" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as "the lie of 2009". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. "President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: "Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?"
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual." He thundered, "The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!"
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy
The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: "One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas." With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in "terror-management theory" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer "grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as "Tiller the baby killer", a criminal guilty of
"Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original]."
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: "I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us." Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: "Death
lives!"
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party "Patriots". During a broadcast of "Fox and Friends", Beck opined that Obama
"has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture." As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
"Obama money" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that "Obama's SS" was being
trained across inner-city America.
In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. "Trust me", Beck said,
"Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so." (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: "Whitewater is about healthcare.")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. "He's opened our eyes to so much."
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. "We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as "required reading" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that "coercive taxation" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of "amours" with "old women," and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
"powerful influences congregating in the United States" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
"conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government."
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of "promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes."
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party "suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place."
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. "If you control the food supply", Mack warned, "you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery."
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. "He's a big hero now in the pro-life community", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. "Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power."
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: "Bart the Baby-Killer."
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. "Nigger!" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a "faggot", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of "Kill the bill!" drifted into calls for violence. "I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. "You haven't heard the last of me!"
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. "The motion to commit does
not support life", Stupak declared. "It is the Democrats who have stood up...." Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, "Baby
killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. "If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. "Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again." Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to "drop by" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: "Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.

aned by Woodward's Fire
by Leslie H. Gelb
September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm
The president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the
fallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.
Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the
closed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were
helping The Washington Post's sleuth write "the inside story" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of
Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:
Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to "tell their side of the
story." By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,
no one looks terribly heroic.
Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,
and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a
brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that
he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.
The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals
did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what
the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after
they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The
military didn't provide him with that, either.
As they say in Missouri, "Give me a break." If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what
he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White
House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't
understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's
wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the
strategy all by himself.
This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear
enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to
pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told
Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the "classic" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. "I think about it
more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at
the end?" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011
deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: "I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole
Democratic Party." Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:
"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan." So, if he wanted such a plan, he
should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.
Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.
And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom
well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up
their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,
victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,
Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not
a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.
breakAd
The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over
naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and
perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the
usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.
There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than
right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner
sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My
information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt
that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost
always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General
McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in
advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as
much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified
U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,
that everything was "conditions based." That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.
So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be
going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: "You have to recognize
also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been
enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after
it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives." The brilliant general said as much
to others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.
So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on
forever.
Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe
him, despite his history of calling for "victory" and "defeat" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book
demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to
this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.
Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How
Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and
use power in the 21st century. He is president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.

David Miliband lost by less than 2 percent to his brother Ed. Ed is the new leader. David was marginally hurt by Tony's
book but more by Mandelson's endorsement coupled with his harsh statements about the left. This is something of a
regression.
Sid
 --- 

Ed beat Davis by 1.3 percent. Ed's acceptance speech to Labour conference says that the party was betrayed on Iraq and
that trust was lost as a result. "I get it," he said. He sets his goal to the party: "Win back your trust." Very clear repudiation
of Tony. He ends: "Turns the page.. .the work of the new generation begins." Sid
 --- 

Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting, David was ahead. But when the
votes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even
more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had
more labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's "new generation" rhetoric covers that
regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new decision, will be elected by the party.
Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective
yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived, it should go without saying.
David lost precisely because he held responsible positions.
Sid

The marginal vote undoubtedly was driven by reactive and residual feelings about Tony. David paid the price.

John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the "New Labour Establishment", in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown "moved a millimetre" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the "cork-popper" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way
things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.

agenda and won the day. As the Secretary who came in determined to elevate development, you have a great deal to
take credit for in launching the first national development policy. And as my PPD staff briefings with Gayle on the Hill
today demonstrated, the PPD sets the table beautifully for the QDDR.

Diplomacy Before and After Conflict
By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
"The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state."2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of "preclusive victory," which he describes as "anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures," requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to "coordinate and
rationalize" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act "unconventionally"), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the "negotiating" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
"I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war."8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but "in a box," posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
"smart" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
"60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision."' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, "We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces."' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is "deeply problematic" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any."
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
"fatigue" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
"whole-of-government" but a "whole-of-theinternational- community" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in "nationbuilding," a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the "Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force."2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
"comprehensive" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the "expeditionary diplomat." Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the
same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this "special force" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq." These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, "The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,
however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously."'
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the
answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith
writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a
lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to
be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one
goal.3°
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,
working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the
consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out
by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.
The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider
these issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the
Harvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. The
author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze, Jill
O'Donnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.

Hillary -
1.4(B), 1.4(D), B1 — Declassify on: 09/29/2025
Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!
Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.
I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.
Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.
All best,
1.4(B)

Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading
A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for "rotation," provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a "freier" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of "creative ideas." Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And
please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working
with him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge
him forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own
purposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,
from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted
Bibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in
terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about
Abu Mazen's politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a "clarifying moment." The world will of course blame
Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated
solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The
Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and
they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations
and time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as
we keep the door open.
