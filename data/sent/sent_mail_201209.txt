Editor's Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of "The American Bible:
How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation," is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor.
By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN
What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by "we."
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, "There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger," theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled "Innocence of Muslims") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different "we." From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, "I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere."
"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. "The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation."
In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as"This Is Water," novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the "natural, basic self-centeredness" that puts "me" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious "default setting" fosters the sort of "blind certainty" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that "default setting" — to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

Wallace focused in his speech on the individual "I." But his critique can be applied as well to another "default
setting" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of
Give:5
According to those who stormed the embassies, "Innocence of Muslims" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy "Sam Bacile" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning "the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed "Innocence of Muslims" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as "Sam Bacile" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that "Islam is a cancer."
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as "blind certainty."
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real "red line" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of "blind certainty," unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the "cloud of unknowing" that hovers over every major religion.
The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence
of Islam."
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.

Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances." But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.
We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.

We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State
Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated
anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.
TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, "Get your act together"?

RICE: No. I think that the president communicated directly with -- with President Morsi and had the
opportunity to -- to understand our expectation that Egypt will do what it can to protect our facilities. So
that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.
TAPPER: Dr. Rice, thank you so much for coming here today and answering our questions.
RICE: Good to be with you.

The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:
By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."

I'm heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also
traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

Associated Press
Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting "No to militias."
"I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform," said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
"No, no, to militias," the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. "Benghazi is in a trap,"
signs read. "Where is the army, where is the police?"

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, "The ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya lost a friend."
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous," said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. "We felt that the revolution is going in vain."
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the "state of terrorism" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means "Supporters of Shariah Law."
"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street," said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. "This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah."

"If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?" he said. "We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over
heads," he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.
One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, "We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over."
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a "High Security Committee" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming," said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster."

first statement to say we were assessing motive and method. The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to
say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him "Rone," and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known, We honor the memory of our fallen

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: "We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco." No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, "Trusting in God, it will remain permanent." I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam," The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — "an act of ugly terror."
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, "al-Qaida hit list" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.
QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's —
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause —
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.
