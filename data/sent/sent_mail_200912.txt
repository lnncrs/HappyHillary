sullivanij@state.gov B6
Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible. Here are a few comments and
questions:
We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure
what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that
this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?
The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here
too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.
In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony
honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was
asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might
literally save her life.
Look forward to further discussion later today.
 --- 

No I reached him. Thx.
 --- 

Can we get Lisa's lunch rescheduled to before or after? And I'd have to do a letter for Dave's service. What are the
logisitics? Are there rooms for us if we take a smaller group?
 --- 

In thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a
week while K saw Nixon everyday. Of course, if I were dealing w that POTUS I'd probably camp in his office to prevent
him from doing something problematic. Do you see this as a problem?

Re: any truth to this account? Sid
The writer was not only a correspondent for The Guardian there but also apparently was on the Maldives delegation
putting him in various rooms. The accounts from the conference have been very fragmentary, the administration has
explained very little (for whatever reasons and to its detriment), and it is being widely blamed internationally. The broader
lesson I draw from Chinese disrespect for the president (and US) on his trip (I've heard accounts from journalists), its
behavior at Copenhagen, mercantalist economic policy (eg, currency), and its rough use of and contempt for international
organizations, not to mention the strange form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, is the need for policy review. Fear of
Chinese retribution (economy. Iran, etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment, though it should be factored into
scenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new area
for the Western alliance to consult on. Leaving it to Treasury apparently parks policy in a laissez faire twilight zone.
Treasury has been as effective on China as it has been on AIG. Just thoughts of an observer.

Here is rasmussen statement at press conf today:
On behalf of NATO, I warmly welcome President Obama's announcement on the new US approach and commitment to
the mission in Afghanistan. President Obama's decision to substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the NATO-
led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for success. The
United States' contribution to the NATO-led mission has always been substantial; it is now even more important.But this
is not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO have shared the risks, costs and burdens of this mission from the
beginning. As the US increases its commitment, I am confident that the other Allies, as well as our Partners in the
mission, will also make a substantial increase in their contribution. Taken together, the new force contributions from
across the Alliance, as well as the new approach agreed by all the ISAF countries, will help create a new momentum in
the mission in 2010.

Iran
The EU meets in the coming days, and we are hoping for a strong public - and private - position on Iran. Bill has
identified 5 countries that need touching to help drive a good outcome:
I know Huma has discussed with you, but a 2-minute discussion with each that underscores the key points reflected on
your card would do the trick, if you can swing it.
Tx. Also, the intervention, with your modifications, turned out well. The process, in this case, did not generate a good •
enough product -- I tried to make it clearer and stronger this morning and your amendments helped a lot.

Brazil signals recognition of Honduran election
(AP) –40 minutes ago
RIO DE JANEIRO —A top Brazilian official has signaled that Latin America's largest nation may recognize the Honduran candidate who won
last weekend's post-coup presidential election.
Dilma Rousseff is chief of staff for Brazilian President Luiz !neck) Lula da Silva. Rousseff says the Central American country's Nov. 29 election
should be considered separately from the June 28 coup that ousted ex-President Manuel Zelaya.
Previously, the government had said it would not recognize the election unless Zelaya was returned to office and allowed to serve out his term,
which ends Jan. 27.
Rousseff told Brazilian television late Friday from Germany that the coup "is one thing" and "discussing the election" another.
She says "this new process" — the election — "has to be considered."

On Honduras we are ok-- despite complications. We maintain a principled position (no to coup), with a realistic one
based on need to have an end game for Honduras. Our formulation that election was necessary but not sufficient —
succeeded in shifting dynamic in many other countries and pushing back on erroneous press reports alleging
administration vacillation.

Recommended talking points:

We could reach out in the next couple of hours or alternatively early tomorrow. The Eikenberry points sent last night,
plus Holbrooke's add'n, provide a good roadmap.
Let us know how you'd like to proceed.

Got a readout from Rich. We still have work to do on the cables, which we'll do at our session with Eikenberry
tomorrow. The July 2011 date was a trouble spot too -- but there is no excuse for that and that got mostly sorted by the
end.
Everything else was good.
My sincere apologies for missing elements of prep today -- I had to deal with some personal stuff that unfortunately
interfered.
Rich and I have organized a session for tomorrow to nail things down with Karl.

Op-Ed Columnist
Black in the Age of Obama
By CHARLES M. BLOW
A hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened "A Tale of Two Cities" with the now-famous phrase:
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ..."
Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in
America. So far, it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first
black president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial
tensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.
Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst for
an era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of
hope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they've
gotten worse.
The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.
A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced
subprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with
the lowest homeownership rates.
According to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,
the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate
over that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,
the rate grew by about twice that much.
And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, "food insecurity" for
American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that
food insecurity.
Things on the racial front are just as bad.
We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester
with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially
offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results
of image searches of them.
And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008
hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate
crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would
include Obarna's ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the
other racial groups have fallen 19 percent.
This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of
blacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that
percentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.
The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among
blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites has dropped
to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.
Also, this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for
accidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his
mouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat
Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the "personal failings" of
Tiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year,
"Precious," features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president
feels like a nice counterbalance.
However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama's
enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their
voices would have presumably held greater sway.
This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to
African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In
the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts
to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.
The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.
According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama
would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able
to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.
In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.
In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,
researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his "true
essence." In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The
more people identified him with the "whiter" images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice
versa.
The Age of Obama, so far at least, seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as a
White House gamesman. It's unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect, but an Obama Backlash is
increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.

There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may go
tomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we
would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.
We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to
vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania,
Zambia, and the AU to exnlain that WP have our own imnpratives hut ma cunnnrt thp fart that they are taking a
principled stand.
We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not
formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice
with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.
Ultimately, however, the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

Landler has called me twice -- I haven't called back because I don't want to go down the road.
I talked to Matt and off-handedly asked about the issue -- he said that people are deeply unhappy with our friend, but
not much else. Said he didn't think anything was imminent. But it was not a very optimistic conversation.

I went back upstairs with Dr Kissinger and we talked about it. I regret the seating, it just begged Meacham to interview
you, to ask a question, then alternate answering. Was just a very different dynamic than you two before the sitdown. It
would be bad TV. But it's print.
So as an observer, and I think this will come across to the reader, it was a fascinating meeting of two eras that are very
different but very the same. Two very different people, but the same job, experiencing it much the same way. His spiel
at the end about the goal should be more than ending the war will translate well.
And most importantly, the photos look great
He was also a sport and called my friend and talked for 10 mins about non-proliferation

 --- 

I. Introduction
The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in
bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,
defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global
Intergovernmental Affairs ("S/SRGIA"), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the
Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in
collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the
Secretary's and Administration's priorities.
II. Key Objectives
The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global
needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will
also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,
promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and
facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with
Department priorities.
III. Next Steps
This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and
implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below
S/SRGIA' s work-planning process.
A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.
Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the
needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities
that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'
concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,
the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority
activities will be as follows:
1
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries;
• Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local
representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role;
• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State
Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;
• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the
State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;
• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate
change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;
• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private
Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional
Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and
the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and
• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign
intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.
intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their
global goals.
B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
U.S. intergovernmental officials.
State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are
competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of
their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both
challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued
competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach
activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international
organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are
not limited to the following:
• National Governors Association;
• National Lt. Governors Association;
• U.S. Conference of Mayors;
• National League of Cities;
• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;
• National Association of States Attorney Generals;
• National State Legislatures; and
• Councils of State Governments.
Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach
objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State
Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and
policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and
public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected
officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.
territories. Specific objectives are to:
2
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities
for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department
priorities;
• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with
principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;
• Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors
Washington conferences in the fall;
• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad
required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda;
• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;
• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;
• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;
• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of
Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible
parties; and
• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government
leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's
National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,
etc.).
C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.
Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and
domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the
objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's
authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the
auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the
International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign
government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the
US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of
government visitors in FY10.
Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in
partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local
governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:
• United Cities and Local Governments;
• Metropolis;
• The World Urban Forum;
• UN-HABITAT;
• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization;
• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;
• The World Mayors Council on Climate Change;
3
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Sister Cities International;
• Local Governments for Sustainability; and
• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.
Priority activities will be as follows:
• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach
with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,
India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,
Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle
and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;
• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what
foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US
counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,
opportunities, programs and connections.
D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.
One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the
government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to
implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart
capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and
offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of
intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of
USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors
and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with
existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the
outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in
the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.
S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived
from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA
will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities
will be as follows:
• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated
resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment
needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local
leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;
• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity
Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for
institutional capacity development going forward;
• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity
building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts;
4
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity
development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private
partnerships;
• Prioritize discrete initiatives to "fast track", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,
Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and
translate priorities into actionable interventions;
• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to
global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;
• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA
capacity building initiative; and
• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their
projects and Department priorities.
IV. Administrative Activities
• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,
consular affairs, etc.; and
• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office
websites.
V. Budget and Staffing
S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.
VI. Assessment of Progress
The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global
concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State
Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office
will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local
governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for
participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to
achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.
With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to
work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the
current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this
constituency.
In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies
and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to
expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the
long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials
abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide
leadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address
regional State Department priorities.

In addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG
programs, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in
synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be
another long term goal for the office.

I've asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday.
At a high level, I think leaders' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,
funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they're not, then
Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.
Todd's view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.
You would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.

Will get back to you on the specific process, but my understanding is that it will be a series of bilats and possibly some

See the story below. Consensus recommendation is that you call PR and MM tomorrow or Wednesday. Because we
expect them both to go to the press after they speak with you, we believe it would be best for you to keep the calls at a
very high level. Essentially:
O Two months have passed since your trip to Belfast and you're checking in;
• You're concerned about the news reports;
O You understand that there are substantive differences and frayed nerves, but you want to encourage all parties
to take positive actions and avoid unhelpful ones;
• You remain prepared to assist in any way — you are personally invested in seeing them work through to the
completion of this process;
• Declan is hard at work, but his efforts are hampered by the lack of progress and the public conflict
You would be mostly in listening mode and wouldn't engage substantively on the issues that are dividing them — parades
(Sinn Fein doesn't want to concede anything on parades without a date for devolution) and a date (DUP doesn't want to
set a date until they get progress on parades).
If you're amenable, we-can move forward and schedule the calls.
Thanks,
Jake

With the annual Pentagon budget bill due on the House floor this week, a familiar face may be missing.Rep. John
Murtha, chairman of the House Appropriations defense panel, was hospitalized Sunday night because of abdominal
pains. The 77-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat had been feeling ill with what he thought last week was swine flu but the
hospitalization appears related to his gall bladder."He's currently resting and doing well," his office said. But a major

Poll: Clinton approval soars
By: Eamon Javers
December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST
A new poll of avid news watchers shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a much higher
approval rating than the man she once campaigned against and now works for, President Barack
Obama.
In the poll of 800 registered voters who are self-identified "news watchers," Clinton had a 75 percent
approval rating and a 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent
approval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.
The Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has
not been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agenda,
including the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been
subjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has
been on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues.
The poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th,
and it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on
Obama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls — in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that
Clinton had become more popular than the president.
Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approval
among Republicans — numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she
chooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among
Republicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among
Democrats — 93 percent — but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off
dramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively.
Clinton's Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past
among GOP voters. In fact, part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he
was more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known
figure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s.
"Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,"
said Faucheux. "It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration." Asked
about any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, "She's in good shape now."
The next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who
notched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63
percent among both Republicans and independents.
"Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board," said Faucheux. "Everybody else did well
among Democrats but fell off among Republicans."
Another trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the
rest of the country. "These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest of
the country, even among news watchers," said Faucheux.
Among White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — who is often seen on
television — had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the
lowest approval, at 25 percent.
Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — who are both closely associated with the
economy — both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers' disapproval rating was
41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating.
The poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having
sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13
percent.
Among other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and
41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
both posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod
scored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones
had a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.

China sees no chance of climate deal - source
Thu Dec 17, 2009
Print I Single Page
By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing "a short political
declaration of some sort," but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an "operational accord" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
"We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,"
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
"At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try."
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.
A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how
they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.
On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse
to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from
countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming.

Arturo made a comment publicly about the fact that he had heard from US business interests that the judicial system in
Argentina had deteriorated.
Argentine press pounced — this is apparently a sensitive issue.
Craig is sending me news summaries.
 --- 

Here is the news summary:
A/S Valenzuela's Trip to South America: Valenzuela in Argentina Chile's El Mercurio reports that the visit of A/S
Valenzuela resulted last night in another misunderstanding between Washington and Buenos Aires because of
statements by the US official regarding the management of the Argentine economy. Controversy arose over statement
by Valenzuela during a restricted meeting with the local press in which he echoes the concerns of American
businessmen in that country regarding "judicial insecurity" and the management of the economy. Valenzuela, also
indicated that has been noted "change" in the investment climate for US businesses and reminded those present that
"in 1996 there was a great deal of enthusiasm regarding investment" in Argentina. The Argentine Foreign Ministry
responded in a communiqué that the government "has not received complaints from US business with interests and
investments in the country." Interior Minister Florencia Randazzo lamented that "some officials revert to old practices"
when there is the expectation of a new period in US foreign policy." Argentina's Clarin carries the same story titled
"Official Anger with Obama's Envoy Because He Spoke about Judicial Insecurity" with the Interior Minister's riposte
"Argentina is living in a period of complete judicial and institutional guarantees" and the nation "has left behind the
period in which an official of another country can tell ours what guarantees should exist to benefit its own
interests." INFOBAE.com adds that Minister of Justice Julio Alak described Valenzuela's statements as "unprecedented
and unjustified."

Thanks so much. I think that, given what was possible, we got a very good result.
Thanks for all your unwavering support throughout the year and for the pivotal role you played in the final 48 hours.
Your diplomacy Thursday was hugely important, starting to shift things in our direction, and then the President's
intervention Friday put us over the top. An awesome 1-2 punch -- the best in the whole wide world. I'm honored every
single day to work for you. Hope you get some rest over the holidays. Best, Todd

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen
deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded

..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated
Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful "dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know
this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made
It look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements
and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was "the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and
fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries have bullied developing nations,"
fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made
the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate
saying "no", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who
denounced the Copenhagen accord as "a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.
The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50
or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of
state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub
was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerful
heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his "superiors".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. "Why can't we even
mention our own targets?" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed
enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should rich
countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw
up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would
get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global
emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak "as soon as possible". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one
else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not
been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks
popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need
a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: "The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans." On
the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of
Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than
anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for
the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate
regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only
opportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as
did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing
countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-
opting the language of equity ("equal rights to the atmosphere") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish
campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on
removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. "How can you
ask my country to go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number
stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent
hours in heads of state meetings, "not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants
to weaken the climate regulation regime now "in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a
few years' time".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But
China's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is
becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.
Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this
magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This
is fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only
not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more
despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of
optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.

"...And finally, a few of you have asked about the schedule of the Secretary of State over the next few days. I can tell
you this morning the Secretary departed Washington and she stopped at the North Pole for an important bilateral
meeting with a well known international figure. During the meeting, in a formal demarche, sung to the tune of Twelve
Days of Christmas, the Secretary outlined her aspirations for the new year. They include, and feel free to hum
along: open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of
women, fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United
States Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation,
and lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox. Okay, that last one's not on her list, but Harold Koh and I thought it

Ops just passed us the following on latest developments in the Goldman case, courtesy of our Embassy in Brasilia:
-- David Goldman's Brazilian lawyer and the family's attorney are currently attempting to negotiate a "voluntary return."
--If those talks fail, Goldman will request the Brazilian police execute the involuntary return ordered yesterday by a
Brazilian judge. This outcome would create a negative PR climate.
--Brazilian police "think" they know the boy's whereabouts.
--Return to US likely will occur on an NBC News-chartered aircraft, as Goldman has inked some sort of exclusive deal w/
NBC for the story.

Civilian, military planners have different views on new
approach to Afghanistan
By Rajiv Chandrasekaran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01
Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal's request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.
Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told
McChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than
half that number by next October.
Ten days after Obama's speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the
combined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal's goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.
"It's an open issue," a senior Pentagon official said last week.
Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with
differing views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, according to more than a dozen senior
administration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss internal deliberations.
Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and
whether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war.
The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White
House and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.
The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date
by seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration
official said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department
activities in Afghanistan to prevent "overreaching."
The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the
senior administration official as limiting military operations "in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two
goals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government." The use of resource-
intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to
be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.
"The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy," Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,
using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. "This is not 'go out and occupy the whole country.' "
Setting limits
During a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.
Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White
House Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to
Afghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.
Obama's essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, "Don't bite off more than you can chew."
White House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style
counterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in
Afghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White House's
desired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-
capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.
Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the
administration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon
strategists and McChrystal's advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less
extensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come
to be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.
Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing
troops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the
approach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by
trying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training
local security forces.
McChrystal's plan, the senior Pentagon official said, "is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people
are trying to spin."
Dissent over drawdown
During strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp
relief over °baffle's decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011.
McChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central
Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to
make the drawdoWn "conditions-based."
"There was a lot of push back" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.
The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that
resonated with Obama and Biden.
Cartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited
counterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, "but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai
government, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is
not prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this."
It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that
McChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department
paperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed
by the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.
"Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president's intervention was to say, 'Okay, if we're starting in July
of '09, then we're really talking about July of '11," said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.
Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals
would be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough
review of progress in a year's time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal's request to increase the Afghan security
forces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.
The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain
the specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press" the
Sunday after the speech, said that perhaps only "some handful or some small number" would be withdrawn. Biden, during
his MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be "coming
down as rapidly over the next two years."
The ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. "Is the
surge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?" asked a senior
Democratic staff member in Congress. "Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows."
One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers "don't know if this is all over in 18 months, or
whether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes."
"Until they tell us otherwise," the officer said, "we're operating as if the latter is the policy."
A 'dramatic change'?
Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been
circumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House
has embraced McChrystal's original plan.
"We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn't try to clear and hold things more than we needed to," said a senior
commander involved in the war. "It wasn't a dramatic change by any means."
White House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a
slide stating that his mission was to "Defeat the Taliban," which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it
suggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was
redefined to avoid the term.
But to military officers, defeat "doesn't mean wipe everyone out," the commander said. "It means after Waterloo,
Napoleon still had an army but he wasn't going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat."
Even before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.
Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country's nearly 400 districts.
"They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus," a senior
military official said.
White House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over
the summer.
"There was a real narrowing here," the senior administration official said. "Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his
original concept to the new strategic guidance."
The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. "This doesn't turn
around with a speech," the official said. "But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that our
goal is 400,000" Afghan security forces.
The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next
18 months in accordance with the new goal.
"The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever," the second official said. "The
hardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough."
For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers.
"Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country," the senior Pentagon official said. "We've
separated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy.
It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them."
Terms such as "winning" and "victory" have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1
address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term "victory" when fighting "a
non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda."
But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama's speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that "we
are in this thing to win."
"From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win," the Pentagon official said.
"We need to be able to articulate winning."

Just talked to Holbrooke on the slopes of Telluride.
Karzai is preparing to announce his intention to proceed with the election on schedule. He has lined up Qanooni in
support.
SRAP is preparing a memo of potential options for how to move forward on this. When we have the memo I will be sure
to get it to you pronto.
If Paul has anything to add/amend, I will be sure to let you know.

Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:
By Michael Posner
The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") on the Obama Administration's human rights and
democracy policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point:
human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement
each other in the task of making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together
freedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous "Four Freedoms"
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes
development in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also
walls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -
including the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives.
As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: "Freedom doesn't
come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem," she said. But experience shows
us that where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures,
and governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable
police and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to
speak freely, to participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about
government, sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without
development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to
pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, "engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity
of indignation." But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women
who worked to advance human rights around the world.
To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which
she forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for
any regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to
ensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right
approach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century.
