 --- 


 --- 

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.
 --- 

Well he's very young, only 15.
Rumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.
What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weight
of being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can be
properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him.

I have just asked for the state of play this am as messages continued last night until lam.
The bottom line of all of them was not dissimiliar to this message from torn so forwarding this one - namely, all had been
unsuccessful in dissuading Zeleya from going today and several leaders and fm (espinoza) thought call from you might
help but Zeleya appeared in update messages to get more resolute as evening went on to return based upon readouts of
various meetings with him.

 --- 

I just spoke to torn (see b/1)..
•He thinks for the moment a call by you is not indicated - first, Zeleya was unpersuadable by 2am by even his closet allies
and second, torn said folks appear to stepping away from him.
He intends to fly mid-day so there will be plenty of time for more discussion over next several hours.

Release Detail
July 7, 2009 - Obama's Approval Drops In Ohio - Critical Swing State, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds;
2010 Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats
Word format
President Barack Obama gets a lackluster 49 - 44 percent approval rating in Ohio, considered by many to be the
most important swing state in a presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.
This is President Obama's lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since
he was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey.
By a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the
independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval
May 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are "somewhat dissatisfied" or "very dissatisfied" with the way
things are going in the state, while 33 percent are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied," numbers that haven't
changed since Obama was elected.
In the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and
Jennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP
candidates if the election were today.
"The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters
have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems," said Peter A. Brown,
assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
"Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George
W. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding
that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected."
"Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency
by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of
independent votes," Brown added.
"Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.
These numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November
and should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending."
In the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in
the race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.
Former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican
side, with 55 percent undecided.
In general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman's 34
percent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.
From June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8
percentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and
445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data and RSS feed - http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, or (203) 582-5201.

She was flattered that her presence is missed in the building on long trips. Committed to make the building work for S
while she is traveling.
I asked if there are any long trips she's passionate about we would work it out — she said only two — if HRC ever goes to
Antarctica and Africa. I said we would work those out (her cousin is Amb to Angola so that is her real interest).
She was pleased she was impactful.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the
region from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the
main takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical
analysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional
cooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.
All best, Jackie
Key findings from the workshop include:
• Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than
forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000
kilometers of the Chinese coastline.
• The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of
SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.
• Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area
have continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing
relations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of "blue-brown water" naval operations, in which
Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.
The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation
easy. These trends
include:
Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000
miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.
• Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,
Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile
submarines operating close to India.
• Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and
even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along
with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.
• Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in
submarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for
states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.
• The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in
this region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in
homeland areas.
The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.
The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:
• The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate
that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and
• What the United States would lose if it did not support the
Japanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,
capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.
The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially
giving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to
territory of a client of China, a "blue-brown water" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and
to force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than
black and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances
underscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their
military capabilities would suggest.

Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next
phase of free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to
their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the
relationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United
States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific
elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau
delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not
seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau's
comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong
the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

Attached is the latest version of the speech, incorporating comments from Sandy and Strobe, as well as edits from
Cheryl and Anne-Marie and Lissa.
While it has improved, it has also grown in length. It is now just a bit shorter than your Senate confirmation
testimony. There are places to cut, but I want you to see it in full so you can make your own assessments.
John Podesta will send a few additional thoughts later today or tomorrow — the rest of his comments are captured in
this revised text.
Dennis is going to sharpen and hone the sections on the Middle East and Iran, and I will ask Holbrooke to work on the
Af-Pak piece.
I am available any time to discuss.

HRC: Back this morning from Asia.
Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very
positive.
Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as
I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are
two ways:
1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a
handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would
represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it
would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about
our effectiveness.
2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:
a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a
settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.
b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of
housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we
have expressed to them..
•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants
an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help
promote a two-state solution.
This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move
forward.
Of course, I am around if you want to discuss.
Good luck in India. They are very excited about your visit.

Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key
paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,
A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and
subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,
1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --
although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to
continue in perpetuity.
The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15
years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and
40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'
development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic
development.
A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua
Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador
to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July
8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office
of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of
the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.
The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of
the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well
as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility
commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the
U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in
the U.N.
Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,
deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive
expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political
parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to
positions befitting the great nation that is the United States.
Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that
the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials
can be needed.
Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to
elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to
official communications.

Steinberg memo
I spoke with both Kurt and Jeff about Jim's paper on Dai, which Huma has. Both were very impressed but had a number
of substantive thoughts.
They would cast the point in a different way,
which they are thinking through.
Kurt says that he will talk to Jim and then perhaps provide his own thoughts in a paper to you.
Meanwhile, I have asked Derek to do something resembling "debate on a page," to distill the key points and objectives
into a single short document that can serve as a cribsheet and help you avoid the crushing burden of the paper in the
binder.
We are prepared to keep refining and improving the paper thru the weekend.

Report: North Korea willing to hold talks with US AP
By KWANG-TAE KIM
Associated Press
Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report
said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. "We are not
against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern," Japan's Kyodo news agency
quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in
New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,
China and Russia, saying "the six-party talks are gone forever." The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within
the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last
weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North
Korea and the U.S. were slim. "Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective
approach" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks "cheated"
North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more
details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the
U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket
launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range
missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing
international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's
nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. "North Korea will
be a significant topic, but obviously one among many," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in
Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to "small children" demanding attention. At
a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North "has no friends left." North Korea's Foreign
Ministry described her Thursday as "a funny lady" who sometimes "looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a
pensioner going shopping."

I will actually meet you at your house, I have the answers to most of your questions from last night
And will include the 5 points

o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]
o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?
Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred
million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of
numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions- also nearly $200m a year [D(L)]
o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's the simplest way to say it?
[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there is great sensitivity about addressing the
substance of these issues at this time.]
Q: Under the previous Administration organizatioris receiving HIV\AIDs funds from the U.S. Government were required
to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the policy of this
Administration?
A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued both USAID and the HHS over the policy -
and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no
final decisions have been made.

You did a really fine job on Meet the Press today. The Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and Asia points were all right
on the mark. And even though it goes beyond my professional scope, the second half was just as good. Enjoy

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.
Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style especially saving Biden.

DCA negotiations are still on for week after next (11-13 Aug), as requested.
Amb Barco called to request that we slide right one day (13,14 Aug). They requested this based on a visit of Mexican
President Calderon - who will visit Bogota (10-12 Aug). The dep FM and some MinDef officials want to be in Bogota for
Calderon's visit.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that "life begins at conception". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that
if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.
As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie
