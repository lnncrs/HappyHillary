U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms
Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference
By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA
The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks
to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.
U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some
for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as
Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.
Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant
progress has been made on Mideast peace.
The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a
bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal
to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.
The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have
been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.
"The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party," said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The
official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.
The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged
from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995
agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken
since.
Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear
weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt
would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and
Turkey.
"We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before," said the senior
U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.
U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
"We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely
unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted," said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members
of the Nonaligned Movement.
The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.
conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security
conference in Washington in March due to such concerns.
An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that
"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the
countries in the region."
The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building new
Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that
ties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track
next week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration
wants to see.
Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament "as soon as possible." It also called for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't
be accepted, U.S. officials said.
The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available to them on the nature and
scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel."
U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.
Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of
calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.
"They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections," said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation
Education Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a
special envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was
part of the U.S. offer.
The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this
conference for nearly a year.
The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections and
sanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help
nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I.must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

Here's a basic summary:
It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear
weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that US
nonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves
and that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed
attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us
"the most hated" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used
nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 "proposals", most of which were previewed
in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with
nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.
The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.

Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.
The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EU's preparations
to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EU's forward progress. It would
supplement experts' level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and
May 6.
The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent
banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.

The political ramifications of the Greek/European debt crisis
As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal,
etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.
Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an
important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.
As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to
brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.
This is long but worth it.
May 6, 2010, 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence
France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English
and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention
and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a
principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary
Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented
and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by
the International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have
abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new
program calls for "fiscal adjustments" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio
peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest
enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,
has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by
2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could
be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that
Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the
economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by
another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely
optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward
Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece
needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end
of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with
G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5
percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-
G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit
of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an
"upside scenario."The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,
roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign
debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay
the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their "new normal."
Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at
risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors
will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published
recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank
runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a "run," it is not clear where it
stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.
Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans
decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small
chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and
enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a
debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;
leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek
"restructuring," because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks
pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It
all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and
at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under
pressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its
government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely
not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would
produce:-
Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.-
As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term
financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..
Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,
prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent
by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.•
At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will
include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.•
European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive
failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives
have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the
ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a
reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.

Clegg's so-called "modernizing" has failed. So Clegg is saying no deal with Labour, Tories must govern without acting on
their program. He's plalying for another election relatively soon, perhaps a year, hoping to do better, but will do even
worse having played the spoiler. And if Labour goes out, so does Gordon and Labour will have a new face, probably

I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood,
rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water
— perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not
given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous
amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to
CDM and Jake).

Sen Mitchell proposes putting out the following statement tomorrow. We would respond on specific commitments on
Ramat Shlomo if asked.
Special Envoy Mitchell left the Middle East on Sunday, where he completed the first round of proximity talks with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders. The talks were serious and wide-ranging.
Special Envoy Mitchell emphasized the importance of making progress in the proximity talks and of moving to direct
negotiations as soon as possible. We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to
both sides, that are enabling us to move forward. The full scope of these discussions will remain private.
As both parties know, if either side takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously
undermine trust, we will respond to hold them accountable and ensure that negotiations continue.
Special Envoy Mitchell will return to the region next week to continue indirect negotiations with the parties.
 --- 

I think this is about right too.
 --- 

After further back and forth, we've come up with a way to mention Ramat Shlomo and incitement to violence that
should be acceptable to both sides. The additional paragraph would read:
We have urged the parties to help create an atmosphere that is conducive to successful talks, and they are responding,
including President Abbas' statement that he will work against incitement of any sort and Prime Minister Netanyahu's
statement that there will be no construction at the Ramat Shlomo project for two years. They are both trying to move
forward in difficult circumstances and we commend them for that.

Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid

How Come we havent?
This is what we are up against.
Betrayed
They said we were there to save Afghanistan's women. So how
come we haven't?
BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.

As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.
'What are they saying?" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They are telling you to go back to your
country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quite
literally die if the Taliban return," she said.
In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus
whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate "reformed"
Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.
Carefully avoiding the word "women," the general assured the questioning student that only "moderate" Taliban would be
eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of "moderate," which clearly depends on where you sit:
If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a "moderate" Taliban.
Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the "moderate"
Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- and
until we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.
In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school and
of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A few
months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, "The last time we met in this
chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to
school. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government."
The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They
strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not
treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped a
page from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.
But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues, appears
to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustained
rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Since
then, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.
Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras into
including women in 2010? Forget it.
It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages
of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rights
abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing
senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.
In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their
suffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistan
still makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In
the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the
first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report
being beaten on a regular basis.
In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stinging
official condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, "The
current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course of
seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --
before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated
soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain death
while their murderers face 100 percent impunity.
For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equality
was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through the
deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's Affairs.
Indeed, just before his recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measures
designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.
Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai
successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or have
guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.
It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women's access to
work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for "legitimate" purposes. Even
Karzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just
wait until the Americans leave.
This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,
because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of
financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.
Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March, "The subjugation of women is a
threat to the national security of the United States." On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states with
higher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better
predictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie,
along with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of
Islamic suicide terrorism.
So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing
more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan "culture" does not
allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one
coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: 'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only
alienate them [Afghans]." Of course, "them" here refers only to men.
But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan
women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of
gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.
Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women
bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans
assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.
Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,
despite increasing female recruitment and even "female engagement teams," remains a bastion of masculinity, with little
sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almost
exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no comment from
the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.
And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only
damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old
Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploit
women in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmer
working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, "It would be better for the coalition if they could figure
out a way to limit this kind of material."
We can do better -- much better.
The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting
women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.
The military should spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders how
gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternal
and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in all
governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming "peace jirga" that will include the Taliban.
Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent.
Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's
issues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, "There is only one minister in the cabinet, and
she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, in
Bamiyan." Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent
upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.
Better yet, the coalition needs to support "regime change" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom a
moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghan
population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given a
chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable to
marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.
We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and
security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it
has committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality
enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking
measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory
group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken
to implement the treaty's provisions.
Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate and
unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as active
agents in peace and security.
Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of
the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.
To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan
and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existence
not fit for animals.
We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off
(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should have
no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality and
security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to the
issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan are
the right ones: "Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political,
and economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights."
American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women can
continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faith
with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.

Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality
By BARRY MEIER
The likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate without
electrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer, according to a study published Wednesday.
The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, at the Seattle
Institute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and other
researchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful.
Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit to
function, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires pose
risks because they can, on rare occasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.
The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A power
unit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.
The new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long-
term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful, the
unit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the new
study nonetheless.
Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could
someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a
defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.
In recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been
prone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also,
scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or
dangerous.
Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries
were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.
"You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective," he said.
In the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful
initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.
The device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr.
Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone
through several iterations.
The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also
include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.
But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are
largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm
that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.
However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.
Before the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr.
Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year or
more to assemble data from it for the agency's review.

Here is what PJ said on the subject:
The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran. During the call, the Secretary
stressed that, in our view, Iran's recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually taking
steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. There's nothing new and nothing encouraging in
Iran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international
community, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to the
IAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify
efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched on

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010
RIYADH (AFP)— An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the
terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.
"What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means."
"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries."
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know."
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.
"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work," he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
"You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the
countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.
"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"
he said.
"Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"
Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction."
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

Review, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It's worth reading, not least for Frank

The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment
June 10, 2010
by Peter Beinart

anjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs
In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish
college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the
most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. "Six
times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel," he
reported. "Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word
'they' rather than'us` to describe the situation."
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of
Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that "non-Orthodox
younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders," with many professing "a near-total
absence of positive feelings." In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university
in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.
Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against some
firm beliefs. First, "they reserve the right to question the Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist
anything they see as 'group think." They want an "open and frank" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, "young
Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled "Proof that
Israel Wants Peace," and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, "some
empathize with the plight of the Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,
several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.
Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of
American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human
rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and
capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did
not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment
has been working against for most of their lives.
Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to
the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to
human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger
generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.
One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a
Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several
decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to their
horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.
Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-
dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular
American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews
can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz's
students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.
Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew
University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist
narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions." One version, "founded on a long memory of
persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in
Jewish power and solidarity." Another, "nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment
idea of progress," articulates "a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values."
Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.
As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,
particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.
You can see this spirit in "new historians" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist
past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the
human rights guarantees in Israel's "Basic Laws." You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent
willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.
But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To
understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth
considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically
cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. "We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here
and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system," he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into
Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas "campus
engagement." In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government's
behalf. The group that organized his tour was called "Caravan for Democracy."
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now
banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be
called "pre-expulsion." He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish
state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the
Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail
Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from
other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.
You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more
you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of
expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they
usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of Israeli
Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.
Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,
Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the
Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In
fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,
he has declared, would be a "ghetto-state" with "Auschwitz borders." And the effort "to gouge Judea and Samaria [the
West Bank] out of Israel" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking "Sudeten district" from Czechoslovakia in
1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching
concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the
Jewish state.
On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may
have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party
representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-
Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious
to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies
it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they
have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," and "ants." In 2005, after Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that "God strike him down." The
official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist."
Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.
Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, "The last time politicians
holding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain." With their
blessing, "a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order."
Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.
Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli
society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and
more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to
anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent
of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among
Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56
percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—
would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey "a huge
warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth."
You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion
substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In
Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.
(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an "apartheid state" if it
continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of
the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that "Israel has not been democratic for
some time now.") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse,
scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn
for peace.
The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.
On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to "free speech and minority rights." The Conference of Presidents
declares that "Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,
security and peace." These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve
full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything
any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very
liberal values they profess to admire.
After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'
Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was "far more moderate than the media has presented it."
Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that "He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them."
(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day
evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish
Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political debate."
But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline "Jewish
Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government."
Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to
prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a
campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty
International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference
of Presidents has announced that "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]
Save the Children." Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly
demonstrated its anti-Israel bias." When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary
Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had
presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report
implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'
Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—they
leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply
defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist
visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an "animus toward Israel," an
alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like
B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human
Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.
All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics
are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?
The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say
that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon,
called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a "virus." This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli
human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. A
Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports
some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed at
curbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s.
To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own
work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's government
is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make
the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.
In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal
citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational
reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are
unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;
and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them
to be agents of the Israeli right.
These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to
the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when
much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in
conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews
embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,
before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,
politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,
American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more
innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.
But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on
Israel's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they
have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than
their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption
because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their
uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment
is fake.
To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to
replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank
occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the
Orthodox world.
Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the
American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make
up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas
they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and
often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of
non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel "very close to Israel," among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As
secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The
Orthodox "are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University
of New York. "They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights."
But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—
that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-
Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the
Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he
found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,
Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-
served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to
deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.
Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in
the American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,
the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic
veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel
solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the
estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz told the rally that "innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well," he was booed.
America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an
American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish
population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up
among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.
In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of
houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and
politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the
ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.
In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he
watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on
malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli
human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.
Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster
Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word "Arabs, not Palestinians," since
"the term `Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression," while "Arab' says wealth, oil
and Islam."
Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are
morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies
everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have
to do or say to make them scream "no." After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;
settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs
barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?
What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the
memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.
•
But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust
analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about
themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated
the non-Jews living under their dominion. "For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority," Knesset
member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, "and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live
with a minority."
But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the
opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a
luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his
remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets you free."
This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply
bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah
and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess
dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the
dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish
victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of
today's young American Jews as farce.
But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's
Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state "will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and
peace taught by the Hebrew prophets," and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others
to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his party's
militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish
fortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of
Jewish power.
For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood
of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,
from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a
permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into
the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the
face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that their
generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state
on earth?
"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it," writes Avraham Burg. "I
was very comfortable there." I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral
abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an
uncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let's hope
they care enough to try.

You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be
ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions
has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the US, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one
internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for
his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs, yes,
yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. This
incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is a
downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a
lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge
border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.
Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on
Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and "officials were
trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter."
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, "the facts were
completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding." He explained that he was interrogated for
several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-
old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the
Palestinian university in Ramallah.
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and
has criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, "I objected to the
founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object
to the United States as a Christian state." When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,
"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew," he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian
criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?

Secretary Clinton and Huma!
Hope you're both well. The DVD screener should arrive at Huma's sometime this morning.
I can't wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections
to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of
reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to
the Marine Corps to the United Nations
(informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations.
We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations.
And a disclaimer- the film is still a work in progress. We are drastically changing the intro, moving some sections around,
and adding a story about the Marines sending senior Marine Officers to Jordan to negotiate and build partnerships with
Al Anbar's exiled tribal leaders.
I am so excited for you to see it.
Have a safe trip, I hope to see you soon, and all the best,
Love,
Zach

FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like
SB1070, officials in the course of official "contact" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized
to request proof of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot
prove legal status are referred to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels
engage in exploitative treatment of migrants, primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses
have been well documented by international human rights groups, as well as by multiple documentary and
news media reports.

See below....Nelson to support Don't Ask Don't Tell measure. Spoke with Byrd's people too....they think he is leaning to
support it, but would know for sure later today.
Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repeal
By: Jen DiMascio
May 26, 2010 12:08 PM EDT
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell, likely putting repeal proponents over the top in
their quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military.
"I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to be
deceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy does just that," Nelson said. "It also encourages suspicion and
senior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity, this policy encourages deceit."
"I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of the
repeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with military
readiness and effectiveness, and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes," he
said, adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue.
"He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed, he can live with this compromise," Nelson said.
Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they, too, will
vote for repeal, Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defense
authorization bill.
Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with a
compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-
Pa.).
"We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful. He and other senators supporting repeal will be
on the right side of history," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. "While Senator Nelson's vote
is critical, no vote will be taken for granted in these final hours before the Senate committee vote."

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director,
Kristy Trautmann.
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in
August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but
influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in
our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with
far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and
by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds
from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit
organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,
an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people
with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and
ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. "I realized the
impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused
foundation," she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million
has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with
disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national
models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.
Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical
staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money
for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first
such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare
for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at
Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for
Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more
accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming
"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the
issues we have," said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based
in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped
solve are ones that people have been working on for years.
"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders
together to get to the solutions," said Ms. Murray.
"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,
leading by example on the value of true collaboration," said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA
and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.
"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the
community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,
and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her."
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order
"were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds."
"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned
something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's
ideas and efforts."
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to "give back to the community in new ways," she said. A
new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. "We
have to keep the fire burning."
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program
director for six years, was promoted to executive director.
"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the
foundation into the next decade," said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. "We know
that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the
populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community."

A new Buffalo Bill is catching the world's attention.
On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's
catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland.
In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said this:
"From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu,
Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and
sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the
first Chinese-American to play in the NFL," said Clinton.
Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, "It felt good. She's a very important person, and so
for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good."
Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5", 250
pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track
and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football.
>»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the
first 15 minutes of practice
"It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but
at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football," said Wang.
Wang is expected to make the team, and his goal is to make a difference.

The Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was not signed last week in spite of both leaders having said that it would be.
Erdogan and Aliyev are now saying June 7 or 8. We have learned that a serious commercial arose that needs to be

have been a factor. S should be aware of this. Thanks... Dick

FYI — the Senate is likely to pass the supp tonight. And, no nominees from any government agency will be

The Brookings event, especially your opening remarks, were excellent. Very thoughtful, with lots of real-life
examples. We have gotten lots of positive feedback.

Getting good feedback on your remarks. The early stories look good, too. More than one person has asked me, did she
do all that off the cuff?
I'll leave Philippe to answer the tax the rich question, but I loved it.

One could serve till the end of 2011. And if recess appointed, the name stays on the exec calendar and chances are the
individual would still be confirmed the old fashioned way. So there would be no need to be reappointed. The fact is
most people who are recess appointed do get confirmed.

Re: Brookings
Sorry,
just seeing this.
Sanger has a blog item on the NYT site about the comment, but more of a political take in that if you run for president
again your opponents will pull the Brookings tape. And a couple of wingnut blogs asking why you don't just volunteer
more of your own money to taxes, and that you chose Brazil as a "socialist country that sides with our enemies as a
model.". But frankly, I had to look pretty hard to find that, I was the 19th person to read it. Not 19,000th. 19th.
Most coverage was either straightforward about the NSS, or your comments about the debt as a national security
problem.
But feedback I got was strong, people always always always love you in that format.

HRC: Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.
Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs
administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. "At no time in human history," he said, "has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy."
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. "This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam," the new strategy says. "We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates."
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as "together where possible, alone where necessary."
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: "to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation."
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.
Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him everything.
He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.
This is not a good turn of events.

tragedy."

First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and
denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks
his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of his son
Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe,
except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud
Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film, Munich.
Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to have escaped
the participants.)
Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as the
Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so.
Cheers,
Sid
Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not
Serious About Two-State Solution.
July 8, 2009 1 Comment
In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister
told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians.
Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state,
the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)
"He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I
heard from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not
one of them."
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is
Jewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place
here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in
Entebbe Rescue
by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on 4nd
On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day
for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday
night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved
into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One of his less
known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of Memorial
Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State of
Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when
seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between
him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red
lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who
heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in
September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the
Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will "make
sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take "aggressive" action and construction
will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is
simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President
Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might
attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting
as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of
weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago
between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued
construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute
ally of the United States."
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among
members of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to end the crisis
is the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers are empty.
Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they
would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in Washington.
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months
ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together
and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once
again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult
questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.'"
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's acceptance
into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through
the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.
