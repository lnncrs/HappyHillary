Early Draft: International Energy Coordinator
2009-05-17 Position Description - International Energy Coordinator - Draft.doc

Attached and below is a draft of the international energy coordinator position. I have been speaking with David
Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil
in the details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key
objectives in international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the
Secretary embraced in QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's
double-hatting in the past rather than a dedicated staffing).
Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early
afternoon. This is, as you will see, a bit of a high wire act as: B5
I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest
convenience -7 in text edits in caps most appreciated (preferred over general comments). We are pushing so that
by the Secretary's hearing on Weds, we can respond yes should he inquire if this position is in process.
thanks.

Below is the recommended guest list for the August 17 Education Dinner. I solicited input from Nina F, AMS,

number who will not be available in August given the academic calendar. We will work our way down it to get
12-14 outside attendees leaving about 6 seats for State.
The guest list includes university and college presidents, scholars, public intellectuals and journalists who have
thought creatively about the role higher education is playing and could play as part of "smart diplomacy".
Once you sign off on this guest list for invitations (so add or subject any), I will work with Anne-Marie to
discuss format and assignments for folks for speaking.

be helpful. This piece of information may be useful if charges are made that he is somehow a spy. besides
writing a book about the former president, is Shane Bauer, one of
the hostages, is a young photojournalist who is a Nation Institute grantee. He is an Arabic speaker who has a grant to
write on Middle East issues. He has written not only for The Nation but also for Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco
Chronicle, and most importantly, the Al Jazeera English speaking website. According to he lives in the region
most of the time, was traveling with his girlfriend in Kurdistan, has an interest in Kurdish affairs, was on a hiking trip, and
obviously and inadvertently crossed an unmarked border. He was not acting as a journalist at the time, though he is a

Colombia Defense Cooperation agreement
Our chief negotiator for the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) just reported that a provisional agreement has been
reached with the Colombians. It will have to go through translation and other scrubbing over the next couple of weeks
before its ready to be signed but this should be good news for your proposed meeting with Foreign Minister Bermudez
next week. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jake, when you can, I think I speak for the group when I say that we'd like and After Action Report on last night's date
with Dr. Senkler - especially curious if your plan to transition from the initial expanded group to a more restricted
bilateral meeting worked as planned.
And while I'm writing, here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times - with this
classic line: "...a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny
noises whenever she said something striking."
Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
"I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed," Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
"I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance," she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to "boogie" with African dancers.
"And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself," she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.
Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of "tough love," as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
"This is possible," she said. "You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility."
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict," said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. "Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries."
"Now," he added, "comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit."
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go," she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
CanctIn or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde "a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa."
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, "I bring you greetings from President Obama."
She called him a "son of Africa" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

Re: AAR
She painted a very positive portrait of the trip, and said that nothing knocked you off stride, you staved focused.
I'm just reading the clips now and the wrap up pieces are uniformly terrific. Might have been unorthodox, but you
certainly raised the awareness in the US about Africa. The debate over the legitimacy of covering your town hall
remarks all come with a heavy dose of the depravity occurring there. So there's a silver lining as people talk about
something they otherwise wouldn't - irrespective of what triggered the conversation.

Fyi
 --- 

Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key
paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,
A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and
subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,
1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --
although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to
continue in perpetuity.
The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15
years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and
40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'
development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic
development.
A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua
Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador
to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July
8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office
of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of
the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.
The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of
the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well
as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility
commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the
U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in
the U.N.
Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,
deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive
expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political
parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to
positions befitting the great nation that is the United States.
Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that
the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials
can be needed.
Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to
elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to
official communications.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.

Report: North Korea willing to hold talks with US AP
By KWANG-TAE KIM
Associated Press
Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report
said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. "We are not
against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern," Japan's Kyodo news agency
quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in
New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,
China and Russia, saying "the six-party talks are gone forever." The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within
the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last
weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North
Korea and the U.S. were slim. "Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective
approach" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks "cheated"
North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more
details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the
U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket
launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range
missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing
international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's
nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. "North Korea will
be a significant topic, but obviously one among many," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in
Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to "small children" demanding attention. At
a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North "has no friends left." North Korea's Foreign
Ministry described her Thursday as "a funny lady" who sometimes "looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a
pensioner going shopping."

And will include the 5 points

o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]
o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?
Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred
million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of
numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions- also nearly $200m a year [D(L)]
o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's the simplest way to say it?
[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there is great sensitivity about addressing the
substance of these issues at this time.]
Q: Under the previous Administration organizatioris receiving HIV\AIDs funds from the U.S. Government were required
to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the policy of this
Administration?
A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued both USAID and the HHS over the policy -
and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no
final decisions have been made.

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.
Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style especially saving Biden.

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that "life begins at conception". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that
if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.
As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie

The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW). New Delhi, India.
Description:
The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW) has established a fellowship in memory of Brooke
Shearer, a former ICRW board member and dedicated advocate for improving the health and economic status
of women in the developing world. The Brooke Shearer fellowship in India is an opportunity for U.S. early
career professionals with graduate degrees to contribute to research and programs that advance gender
equality and empower women in Asia.
Shearer was a stalwart supporter and contributor to ICRW's mission and work. ICRW honors her commitment
to women with a fellowship program based in our Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India, a tribute to
Shearer's fond memories of her time spent in India during her youth and her tenure on ICRW's board.
The 2009 fellow will work in collaboration with the Asia director of the social and economic development group
on programs, research, advocacy, and business development related to the group's portfolio of work. The
specific activities of the fellow will be determined based on the substantive and technical skills, interests, and
experience of the candidate selected and the current opportunities in the group. Likely projects for
engagement include:
• The PACE program—an ICRW collaboration with Gap Inc. on workplace and personal advancement of
female garment workers in India, Cambodia, Bangladesh.
• The Counting Girls Project—a project examining son preference in India and China, the effectiveness of
specific policy efforts in addressing sex selection and discrimination against girl children, and the potential
conflict between the human rights of girls and reproductive rights for women.
• Delayed Marriage—project examining the social norms that would need to be changed to eliminate early
marriage.
Primary Duties:
The fellow will engage in the following responsibilities and tasks:
• Develop technical content of projects including conceptualization, data analysis, background research,
program and evaluation design, survey and instrument design;
B6

and relationship management;
• Work on project management tasks including administration, budgets, team coordination and work plans;
• Write, synthesize and present findings in reports, briefs, papers and presentations;
• Assist with business development activities including grant writing and proposals;
• Prepare research and program findings for communication to various audiences (donors, policy-makers,
program personnel, researchers) at various forums and opportunities (meetings, events, cultivation,
deliverables).
Required Education, Skills, Knowledge and Abilities:
• Applicants should have a Master's degree (5 years or less) or Ph.D. (1 year or less) in the social sciences,
public health, international development or a related field. Qualified candidates with relevant job experience
on program or policy-relevant social science research are preferred. Due to the nature of the fellowship
eligibility guidelines, only US citizens or permanent residents, residing in the US or in India, will be
considered.
The following skills are required:
• Strong analytical and conceptual skills along with substantive background in gender and social science
issues and research;
• Desire and commitment to link research with policy and programs;
• Strong interest in understanding on-the-ground development research and program needs and activities in
Asia;
• Excellent written and verbal communication and presentation abilities;
• Ability to work collaboratively with professionals at different levels, including colleagues, partners and donor
organizations;
• Strong qualitative and quantitative research skills; and
• Ability to participate in fundraising and networking activities.
Duration:
One fellow will be selected each year for a term ranging from six months to one year. The fellowship is a full-
time commitment.
Terms:
The fellowship award consists of a monthly stipend, health insurance and round trip travel to India. The fellow
is responsible for all local accommodations and living costs. The fellow will be provided with office space and
support in ICRW's Asia Regional Office in New Delhi.
To Apply:
To apply, please submit a letter of interest and curriculum vitae to jobsAicrw.org.

Gentlemen, for your information below.
Werner
GFC
To whom it may concern from experience speaking!
RSO Niall,
Please be aware and as you have requested my elaboration in written format. As briefly
discussed in the meeting today, the LGF operate at what I would consider the "Threshold'
Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning, that our work schedule, hours and sleeping pattern'
the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.,
,
time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .
etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,:
LGF's ability to provide security.
To better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .
nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)
of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.
Snap shot of an average day for a shift:
1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with "In-Service Training". .I
Convoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx i
during the day) followed by actual convoy movement.
2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site,
3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site.
4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. slii
then actual convoy movement
5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment are
down loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.
6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is accounted for and
secured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watch
movie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc.
7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers tit
wake-up and grooming and breakfast.
This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a,
hours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional
(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1
organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually
meals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.
After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings into
night shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the evening
briefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and are
again with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea i
one good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, fol
two more night shifts).
When finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah
(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They the
have to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designated
training day. Third day is a scheduled off day.
If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio',
from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establish
rhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiek
over the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt,
of energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:..
after 5 and 6 weeks.
In summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.
sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.

I am forwarding a few pictures I have received in the, past few days. I would
hope that you fonward these. to your contact vvithin the DOS. I .suspedt you have
many if not all of these pictures, but I want to identify specific individuals in the
AGNA leadership that are present in these photos. As I mentioned tollIBLEL
yesterday, I am Convinced the greatest threat to the security of the Embassy is
the erosion of the guard forces trust in its leadership and ultimately the DOS.
The failure of to protect those they have
been tasked to lead is unacceptable, and if not held accountable will futher
compromise our mission.
The chain of command's failure to curtail deviant actions and to tv.
hold him accountable for countless infractions invloving alcohol has made ;.I),
ineffective. This has lead to threats and intimidation as the only means
to accomplish the day to day operations here and at the Embassy. This is '.
a onetime incident that went unnoticed by direct 'chain of commanf,
These are events took place over the past year and a half and were ignored Iv,
the leadership at the cost of the well being of countless guard force members
If these individuals are_ not held accountable for their actions it will only emboldei;
those who remain to make the same offenses against this guard forde. In
addition., these photos as many were made public on Facebook and traded
amongst the guard force should be used in promotion boards so that future
leadership of this contract can be assured of the character of its leaders,
Respectfully,

This is not the message that this guard force needs ...

We're still pulling material for you, but in them meantime i wanted to let you know the following (which I'll
send as full documents later):
1)State Department Human Rights Report 2003 discusses the problem of rape in custody in Sri Lanka
2) Amnesty International issued a full report on Rape in Sri Lanka in 2002 (with specific cases cited and a
general discussion of the problem being on the increase)
3) UNHCR website has a a page devoted to rape in Sri Lanka and references the Amnesty International Report
4)Asia Human Rights Commission issued a report titled: Sri Lanka: Systematic Detention, Torture, Rape and
Murder as Weapon of War (2000)
I checked the BCL that came from Melanne's office with this information. It was cleared by JO, PRM, P, D/L,
D/S, AF, and assorted others.
The problem is that it was not sent to SCA or East Asia and should have been. But the rest of the building
signed off on it.
Also, it is clear that the reference in the Security Council statement referred to rapes in the past.The first
reference is to rape in the DRC and Sudan. Two sentences later we say:
"We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere. "
Can you download these documents if I email them to you? Otherwise I can try to paste them into emails.

Operative language / Sri Lanka:
The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
there were serious problems in some areas. There were no reports of security
forces committing politically motivated killings and no reports of
disappearances; however, the military and police reportedly tortured, killed
and raped detainees.

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know, as chief of US
mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head
of UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months
there. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of
increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks
there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace
Karzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with
Holbrooke, not because he can't reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is
on a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you
can reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today:
"The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare
public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W.
Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide.
"Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized
to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it
could undermine national stability.
Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of
polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide
and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could
be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin."

HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah
About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.
The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun
went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, "I shot a
man." It just happened.
I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,
Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party
who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own
success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.
The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,
unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of
powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the
murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter
how well armed, never felt it.
Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various
Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.
They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and
damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of
course that is frightening.
But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John
Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.
strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.
Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those
of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the
power that they wish to exert.
Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the
network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to
Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected
to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of
tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have
committed.
Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did
he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in
New Orleans where Republicans "wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have
impeccable taste in silk stockings" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--
both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good
evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered
hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).
This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A
Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he
wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was "saved," for example, he said, "My goal is to get to
heaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way." He must have
thought getting to heaven was just another power play.
And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that
Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,
whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.
At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the
strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going
after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in "the most vicious fight ever staged
between man and beast." As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until "he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent." In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,
over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.
It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal
cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric
Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these
powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.
The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons
about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he
surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame
and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the
hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.
Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by
liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his
thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been
interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how
constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I
think he looks within, and says, "I'm okay; you're okay." That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell
by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--
atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have
sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.
But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no
sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try
to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming
to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can
be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,
too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror
can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is
defined as powerless. When he "crumples" on the "loving" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who
administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his
powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.
That's where your freedom and mine come in.
Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban
only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never
share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply
hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.
It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide
of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,
and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In
his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for "disobedient children, unchaste
women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers," and homosexuals. Gary North, the
Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death
penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a
factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you
and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept
responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we "crumple" on his
"loving" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian
Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is "Adore me or I will hurt you."
Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,
thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical
punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
between man and beast." As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until "he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent." In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,

punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the
parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with
horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and
two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a God
who was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.
The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically
unstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing
about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-
VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us "back from the
brink" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they
would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is
that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,
Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and
Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler
didn't have nuclear weapons.
I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably
had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as
separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that
were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he
wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.

It sednis that Obama is having a lot of difficulty getting business people involved in his various
initiatives. At least that is the sense I get from reading the papers. I know that Hillary is well connected to a
nuniber tit UUSIlIeSS people bui. haven' seen many of them show up in any kind of supporting roles.
I have plenty to do, but it certainly seems that my background and experience could be helpful in some

.... for terrific talk and discussion. Your robust statement on missile
defense was the best so far. As for your robust push-back on the premise
of my healthcare question, I didn't mean to imply that the Clinton
administration's foreign policy agenda suffered back then—rather, that
there's jeopardy to the Obama administration's foreign policy if the
current debate/fight turns out badly. But you mooted the whole thing by
reassuring us that all will turn out okay.
Anyway, I've taken an aspirin — and thank you profoundly for a great

Cc: Berger, Samuel R.
HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the
Pakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and,
while I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some
AQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more
about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want
to cultivate in the event we "leave" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that
before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can
disabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis
to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan
dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against
military leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we
can go after bank accounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising
the stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Blunter
measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Given
the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing of
the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for
the Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of
course, the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these
days but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our
effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be as
forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training,
whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --
including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can
be played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use
of these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press
them on AQ.
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take
that would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on
threats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence
building measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduce
uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy?
To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could
see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

From your clips:
US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the
US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed "numerous cases of rape and sexual
violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government."
However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department
said that "in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and
sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world."
"We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context," the letter said, adding that Washington remains
concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.
"Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the
protection of human rights," the letter said.
Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United
Nations Security Council.
"We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere," the US secretary of state
had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of
Clinton's remarks.
Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after
decades of fighting.
Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave
off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia.
The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year.
Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting
but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

Note from Joe Wilson... Sid
Hillary: I'm passing on a note below from Joe Wilson. Sid
Dear Madame Secretary,
It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entire
audience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we
are both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.
I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has
been hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,
substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and
pulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local
companies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the
security. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified
linemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and
certification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in
Tanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution
projects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does
and how it does it.
I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing
much of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact
that we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that
have been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to
demonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also good
business.
I look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and very
much appreciate your generosity.
With warm regards and best wishes.
Joe

Thursday, 8 October 2009
SPONSORED LINKS:
Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky
as the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire
from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down
on them.
It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the
Afghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the
meantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.
The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed
the point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a
Taliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles
had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men
the Taliban had lost, I was told "none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just
ran away."
Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military
crisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander
in Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in
the next twelve months.
This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because
they have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of
President Hamid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun
community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty
advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,
Hazara or Uzbek majority.
Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there
is no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.
The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict
quite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this
through roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was
being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory
supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being
suddenly targeted by the other side.
It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But
Afghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more
of the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped
military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that
Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by
American shells and bombs.
So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next
year. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to
suggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.
Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack
jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,
often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks
training. Many of them did not come back.
One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid
properly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not
enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to
foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly
really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of
men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the
Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid.
The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should
be considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.

I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House.
She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this
She advises that we need to give advance notice -
There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.
This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.
Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.

United States Institute of Peace: Background
Proposals for the creation of a government "peace" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a "Peace
Office" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to
establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the
Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known
as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace
academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board
of Directors took place in 1986.
The USIP Act established "an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government
through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace
information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and
peoples of the world without recourse to violence."
USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy
research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-
specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:
® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate
dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and
educating the public through events, films, and other outreach.
O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.
® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,
Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti.
® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?
By David Rothkopf
Washington Post
Sunday, August 23, 2009
When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.
Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,
Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --
but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential
candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)
relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.
Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-
Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while
depicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton's
weight and hair, while her "defense" of Hillary in her essay "Obama's Other Wife" was as sexist as the title suggests.
Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing
outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous
question regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,
which covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The
Washington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of
choice for the secretary of state.
Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in
U.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.
The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized
State Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the
pessimists who invoked the "team of rivals" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,
Hillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes to
tough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White House,
she is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept America's leaders awake all
night.
In these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in
which her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult
personnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of all
administrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --
more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama's centrality amplifies the importance of
his closest White House staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (on
Afghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton's
role.
Given the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand in
some of the nation's most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice
President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problems
of the recent past, Clinton's State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- in
particular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: It
recognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama's vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of the
Middle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.
Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia --
are rivals as well? How must America's alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with rogue
states and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How do
we move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate
players and once-disenfranchised peoples?
In searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recent
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the new
administration's worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include "partnership" and
"engagement" and "common interests." Clearly, Madeleine Albright's "indispensable nation" has recognized the
indispensability of collaborating with others.
Who those "others" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. "We will put," Clinton said,
"special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda." This is the death knell for the G-8 as the
head table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to
the G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waning
days of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from a
traditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world's sole superpower.
Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this year
and will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips to
China and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africa
and the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world.
On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emerging
powers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, we've seen a new American willingness to play down old
differences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on human
rights.
At the center of Clinton's brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideas
in Clinton's speech. "We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks,
coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems," she told me.
"To do that," Slaughter continued, "our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community
organizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of
diplomacy."
A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obama's
technology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission is
to harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks
have played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whether
through a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for
Pakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.
Of course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary has
brought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy
Bottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, such
as Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreach
worldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.
Even just a few months in, it's clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and the
acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, an initiative modeled on the Pentagon's strategic assessments and
designed to review State's priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world,
notably with China. Clinton made women's issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressed
that "the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that
undermines progress and prosperity."
Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International
vice chairman Robert Hormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the State
Department, as well as Judith McHale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. In
the same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India's private
sector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the
self-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The old
campaign teams -- Clinton's and Obama's -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by most
accounts, the administration's national security team has come together successfully, with Clinton developing strong
relationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, has
renewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them, working with Obama
campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Department
seventh-floor dweller called "a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking." Henry Kissinger may
have overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory, but it's not bad,
while the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.
At the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration's talk of
international partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all.
So far, according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House, the two seem aligned in their views. In
addition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on
foreign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoed
his points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling,
the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state has
spoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.
It is still early, and a president's foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the
unexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or
reluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory "smart power" already
does to me.
Nevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obama's unlikely secretary of state is supporting and
augmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama's "other wife," not as Bill Clinton's wife, not even as a celebrity or as a
former presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.

fyi: Hague report and DeMint... Sid
H: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. S
William Hague addresses US fears over Tories'
EU allies
•Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'
•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader
• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt
• quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST
William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties in
Europe during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.
Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners, some of whose members have taken part in
commemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in
Poland.
The shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a
smear campaign by the Guardian and others.
The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking
power.
Speaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, was
not consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, Hague
said: "This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous."
Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.
The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or
issues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: "I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging
discussion on a broad range of issues, but can't get into details or substance of that discussion."
Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a
lesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.
Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the
Balkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.
"No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state
Clinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those," Hague said.
"I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a
smear campaign against some of its members."
He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in
Europe and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. "These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,"
Hague said.
As for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, "five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that
have been criticised." Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance, the European People's party.
On Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: "I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to
distinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find
a Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. "
Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair
would be appointed "over my dead body".

Iran-Contra's Scary Sequel
by Art Levine
The Daily Beast
October 10, 2009 I 6:55pm
Republicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America.
The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the
George W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South
Carolina.
A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint
is best known for boasting that health care would be the "Waterloo" that will "break" Obama. He recently
provoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to "assess" the crisis.
The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who
was expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his "intransigence"
in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied
money for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the
Defense Department.
"DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to
defend a coup," says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for International
Policy.
"Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by
provoking the [DeMint] holds," Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign
Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: "These losers from the Bush administration who drove
Latin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy," one aide told The Daily Beast.
A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American
policy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance
against the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to
appease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration "slow-walked" its
response to the coup this summer, Sweig says.
More recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least
$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into
serious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.
Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington
and helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.
An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya
legal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the
State Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was
subsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which
found he engaged in "prohibited covert activities" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich, who
was later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and
is now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.
"Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelaya
coup," he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as "crap,"
asserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin
American history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich's role: "It's kind of the origins of Swift
Boating," he says. "It's all related to what he's doing now."
Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the
worldwide condemnation of the coup. "It's not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,"
Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking
The New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on
behalf of the Micheletti regime. "I guess my facts interfered with [the] story," he says. "Can you believe some
of my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?" A
DeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide
says they've spoken to DeMint's staff.
Adding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives
say are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He
has firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges
against me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya." But the rumors may add to his aura
of power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by
penning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras."
Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer
Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the
Senate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in
influencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide
to the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an
assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former
ambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—
not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.
Noriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-
July. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings
between supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to
Washington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,
occurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran
supreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified
in favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.
The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama's
picks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere
Affairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown
University's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National
Security Council during President Clinton's second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western
Hemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
in late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, "They're not polarizing figures."
But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint
by defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: "In my studies of military
coups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup," Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he has
continually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,
including the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.
DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an
important crisis. "If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn't Senator Reid brought
them to the floor?" he asks. "There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on
them." Technically that's true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken
up the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, "the State Department's actions were directly relevant to two
nominees seeking the committee's approval."
Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to "break"
Obama—one congressional observer jokes, "He couldn't find Honduras on a map."

Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok
doing this call in the next day or so?
Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.
Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the
court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of
his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.
Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout
(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney
General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning
Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

This is kennedy statement about to go out. Will be joint from u and wjc.
Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most important and influential leaders of our time, whose five decades as Senator
from Massachusetts helped to shape America's history and chart our shared future. During our time in the White
House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health
coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care
reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for
all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in
millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve
America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki,
and his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him, worked alongside him, and called him
our friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.

F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764566 Date: 07/31/2015
 --- 

Attached and enclosed below is the demarche and letter that went out, reflecting your comments.
SUBJECT: DEMARCHE/LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST 28 UNASUR SUMMIT
REF: A. STATE 86734
B. STATE 82581
1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.
2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).
We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in
about a month, following a final review by both sides. As
noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States
access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate
effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in
Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any
U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall
increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or
U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.
3.(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM
Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,
including the importance of coordinating our public
affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).
There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional
referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
will attend the summit provided that a full range of
regional security matters can be discussed, not just the
DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected
UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional
security issues beyond the DCA.
4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28
summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
range of regional security topics during the summit, and
not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
government.
265
5. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to
UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the
Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28
summit.
6. (U) Begin text:
Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:
I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
United States supports the formation and effective
functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
and ensure the best possible communication between
nations.
As you know, our common neighbor,
Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy
alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious
illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened
the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow
by violence and corruption successive,
democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions
of these groups also threaten the security of other
countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many
ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have
beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My
country is proud of the role we have been able to play in
this effort.
This battle is far from won. Our governments and people
are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves
and our institutions from such threats. I am certain
these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming
summit, including the recently concluded Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the
sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in
the hemisphere and the questions your government may have
regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope
the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my
government and the Colombian government have helped
address those questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to make several key
points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a
bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our
cooperation on security challenges within Colombia,
permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian
26fi
facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on
Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that
does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other
nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat
drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a
whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of
U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase
in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not
seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from
Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in
advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be
based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity of states, and
non-interventionism.
We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
reach out to us to seek clarification.
The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the
organization to address a range of security issues that
affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
deciding to discuss these matters. The security
challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
that a collective and collaborative approach to these
matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would
walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are
differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries.
This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these
redlines are crossed.
This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo,
Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an
EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time.
The background portion of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the
unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.

Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's
my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's
allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he
inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to
counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in
the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets
that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-
range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's
ally Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few
long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an
immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces
stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range
Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm
should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible
one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there
suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used
offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario
was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However,
by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has
improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in
Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -
that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,
given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track
for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of
eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a
stark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being
vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the
other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be
on hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.
American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially
sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive
capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a
series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were
expected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.
While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan
was not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based
comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual
deterrence — "impotent and obsolete."
Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was
an impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program
with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.
The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the
START process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national
missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in
Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large
measure about "pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD."
Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied
arms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and
regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last
week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own
merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights
with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the
principles of the ABM treaty.
Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating
strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be
either impossible or, worse, dangerous.

Don't think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event:
TO: Secretary Clinton
FROM: Chris Falvo
DATE: September 8, 2009
RE: NY Local Issues
Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that
opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when
Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have
met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last
month.
H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant
portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is
that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so
instead they are asking sick kids to stay home.
And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.
Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.
Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been
closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for
Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.
Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. "Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' "
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
"Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing," he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. "What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period," he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

Moves the public discussion from settlement freeze to final status. Keeps some pressure on the parties. And seems like you will play a

Going forward, if Bibi continues to be the obstacle, you will need to fmd the ground from which you can make his politics uneasy. I
think you can do that even with current concerns in Israel about US posture. But it will be easier as we rebuild trust so that our future

Finally, need to be mindful of Abu Mazen's politics. Taking a lot of criticism for meeting with Bibi without settlement freeze.

The Power Grid
Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House,
returned from the brink.
•Published Oct 11, 2009
On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care
bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the
legislation instead. "It's just too weak," he told me. "It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real
competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies." And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the
bill. His political assessment was even harsher: "It's effectively dead," he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus
plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone
gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more
for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as
Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to
nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean
into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest
and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill
eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care
paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has
been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have
a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé
and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,
wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in
other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a
matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. "This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship
that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment," he says. "You didn't have the president out there
speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort
with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback" Weiner laughs. "Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-
hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum
that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and
death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of
what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;
he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. "It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this
has become my issue," Weiner says. "If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening." Weiner allows that
he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the
cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an
equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a
"government takeover" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House
pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and
1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently
clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that "up to
now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple
of hours." And he's apparently had no change of heart. "The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large," he tells
me.
Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his
consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to
Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy

Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private
talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting
Gordon Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in
London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers
Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: "I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen."
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: "In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable."
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting "the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. "I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution."
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. "My sight is not at all
deteriorating," he told NBC.
Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: "I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge."
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: "The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect."
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed "the terror council".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: "I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles."
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: "If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations."
He added: "If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially."
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh."

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left "the special relationship"
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone," the source said.
"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off."
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
"spend all day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.
Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute "walk and chat" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate "bilateral"
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must "move in a new direction" and "embrace20a
new era of engagement". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

Holbrooke's Contributions on Af/Pak
Holbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work on
Af/Pak — a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S.
mission in Kabul.
Holbrooke's team is actually getting things done, including the implementation of more
than 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far:
• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.
• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the
consolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of
assistance contracts.
•
• Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.
• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the
Swat refugee crisis.
•
• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border
issues.
)11
• Holbrooke's international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other
special representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more
buy-in, and more patience.
Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Here are some examples:Ill
Defining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)
• The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel
report; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention
Afghanistan
The clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced "Afghanization" -
primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferable
alternative to adding more troops.
• The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;
Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and
speed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,
particularly with respect to the police.
Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:
•
Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuing
reconciliation/reintegration.
• The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate
"non ideologically-committed" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,
and accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the
report, and is now working through the next phases.
Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction
• The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendant
need to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.
Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey
• The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It
does not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.
• [NOTE:
• This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.
Pakistan
• The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.
Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner
• Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the
refugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.
Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority
• The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke's
recent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic
communications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has
been the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan
and Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.
Pursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan's economic troubles and boost
support for the United States
• The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging
foreign investment.

At bottom is the People op-ed. I just checked and ironically the figure comes from Melanne's testimony during an SFRC
hearing, where she stated: ""The scale and enormity of the violence directed at women [in the DRCI can scarcely be
adequately described. Some 1100 rapes are being reported each month, with an average of 36 women and girls raped

Hillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'
Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former
First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.
While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's
thoughts on a trade issue ("My husband is not the secretary of state, I am," she retorted), the emotional heart of her
tour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -
and what she will do about it.
What I Saw in Goma
By Hillary Rodham Clinton
In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.
The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent
conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal
militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe
haven.
Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever
glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their
homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.
Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has
become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an
average of 36 women and girls raped every day.
I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'
pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of
their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then
they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed
to get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.
I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and
abet them. They are crimes against humanity.
These acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us
together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.
But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.
We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health
care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded
in Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have
been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.
Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in
Bukavu, represent humanity at its best.
The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to
prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,
counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers
to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and
front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And
we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist
survivors of sexual violence.
While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the
perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important
when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit
these crimes with impunity.
Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not
end with my departure.
We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the
eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an
end to this conflict.
There is an old Congolese proverb that says, "No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come." The day must
come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and
collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are
strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their
country both peaceful and prosperous.
Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people
seize the opportunities of a new day.

In the caption, Hope Davis says, "They made special teeth for me because Hillary's are very unique. When I popped
them in, I suddenly looked very much like her."

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
? The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
? While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
? "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
? There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left
the room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
? Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
? "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
? Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she
depicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
? Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
? "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
? "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
? After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident." [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
? "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
? On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin." [Branch, 92]
? In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
? On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
? Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
? On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance." [Branch, 554]
? WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
? He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
? WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would
tarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
? Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
? The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'"
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice
president, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
"surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch,
644-45]
Other
? Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking
Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet,
and efficient." [Branch, 161]
> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,
342-343]
> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had
subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the
subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
? Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our
glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as
lighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]
> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their
best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al
would ever do it.'" [Branch, 540]
> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."
[Branch, 557]
? On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard
intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses
the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.
DI 'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She
winced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first
lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]

Just leaving Oslo. Jonas Store sure appreciates his good working rel with you, and seems super eager to help on Afpak.
Rumor is that, with elecitons behind them, he may be moved to (get this!) the health ministry. He's mum on subject,

Counseling That Helps the Dying Live
By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott
Saturday, August 29, 2009
Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House
legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life
counseling. How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.
Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,
including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about "death panels." As a result of these
attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress
have abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.
Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and
the misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother
-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous
scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the
best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest
advances in, pain management.
Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her
family for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and
treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their
ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her
final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke
anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and
exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.
When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully
into the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors,
nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with
friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.
These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling
the cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current
national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her
illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.
It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with
Brooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling
helped make possible. Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not
only does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. If
counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform,
many Americans will be as well.

Our Co-Chairs, now Sec. of State McClintock and Dem. Comm. Chair Prats, have written a book about a campaign that
was historic in terms of a majority in PR and cooperation between statehooders and commonwealthers.
They want a foreword by you & WJC and pictures of your visits. I'll follow up with Cheyrl and Laura Graham on the
foreward and can do a draft if one is OK.
On Palau, I'll be following up with Jake. State's proposal would cut per capita income 20% over six years and 10% over

Relatively positive feedback. Some concern over the increased engagement and lingering concern over Scott's previous
comments. If he sticks to the agreed upon points tomorrow at the presser and in the follow up with the NGOs, think the

Reasonable people can disagree on whatever it was
By Al Kamen
Monday, October 19, 2009
They call it the World's Greatest Deliberative Body (WGDB), Part I.
The Senate Judiciary Committee last week was reviewing an amendment by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to the
USA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment was
intended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.
His colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.
"I would just point to the actual language in here," Klobuchar said, "which is, it's not like this is some pie-in-
the-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says," she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that there
have to be "reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized national
security investigation," and you can't investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there's got
to be some suspected foreign agent involved.
"So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard," she concluded. "There is a standard in
place here."
"That's the standard that is in the bill now?" Sessions asked.
Klobuchar nodded that it was.
No it's not, Durbin interrupted. "Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment," not the bill, he said -- "and I
think it's critically important that you understand what we're establishing here."
Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway.
Blame the gatekeeper
The usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day of
work and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heed
their expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.)
Then, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is "not
accessible" to senior career folks, that she's overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised "open
door" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days, that's
Cheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff,
counselor, overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) --
has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.
Not so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department's top career official. "This secretary is in
touch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making that
happen."
Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August and
Ireland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she'll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving.
There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.
Hey, just telling you what we're hearing.
In a timely fashion ...
The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureau,
in an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette,
Ind., to "assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have been
professionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatest
possibility of success in the foreign service."
Well, good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.
The rest of the résumé
The White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson, a nuclear expert
and senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs, even her undergraduate degree in
nuclear engineering.
Name sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the Energy
Department for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's not
mentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004.
Waterboarding for kids?
WGDB, Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen.
John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federal
deficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction.
"It is deeply personal with me," Coburn explained. "I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see the
potential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going to
waterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood
them with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because we
don't have the courage to make the difference for their future."
Wait a minute! It's just a dunk in the water.

Madame Secretary:
Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.
I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.
Regards,
Tom

I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron
A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be
ashamed
David Aaronovitch
On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The
play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.
In a series of short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne "in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the "Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: "These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?"
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone "from the
Jewish side" apologised for how "the Jews" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. "If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne," he said, "you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland."
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to "Jewish actions" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: "it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us." Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: "I
should apologise?"
But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent "smears" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the "federalist" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in
Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated
Nicholas',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.
c.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of "castrating" Britain's position within the EU by
adopting an "autistic" approach that would take Britain off the radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as "pathetic" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed "for a minute".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness and regret" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a "bizarre
autism" in their discussions.
He said: "They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism."
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Caii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate "bust-up" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesman
in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become "self-governing".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result
of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short." He said Cameron's approach
was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which
Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament," he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a "waste of time for all of us".
"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us," the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. "It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.
It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that," he said. "It is a time of tumultuous waters all
around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time
when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fighting
it out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate".
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of
course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That
should tell you quite a bit huh?" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short
term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke
cries, of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
"That is not how we are seen across Europe," he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
"1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals," he added.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World
By Joe Klein
Time Magazine
Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE
UPI Editor at Large
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., the
Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire
against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,
because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan
experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least
not significantly.
The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times
over the last eight years, replete with terrorist "trainees" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy
pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.
Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.
11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of
Pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient
maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's "martyrs" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,
to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.
Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in
Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's
where al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to
Pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted
Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now
insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal
areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are
widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.
As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is
doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals
will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial
towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will
do/are doing it.
Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs
compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which
has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central
issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.
If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of "no more Sept. lls," what are the United
States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the
Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was
palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was
issuing "too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious
education." Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power
and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.
In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen
has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort
has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many
others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a
Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All
requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY
was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese
ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.
The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY
and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.
Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost
reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not
disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that
reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.
If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to
fight the Afghan government.
The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These
are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the
military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and
Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after
authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.
In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.

Report: Obama's national security team
'incredibly weak'
Wed, 11/04/2009 - 1:45pm
Despite an expansion of the National Security Council staff, coordination of national security policy is still dysfunctional
and there is a lack of strategic guidance from President Obama, according to a group of leading outside experts and
former officials.
"Reform must take place," said dames Lalher, President & CEO of the r!-olect on n; alone! Security Reform (PNSR), If
you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... you're not going to like what's coming in the future."
"Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions," reads PNSR's .new report . The
congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "Strategic management of the national security system remains absent
and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile," the report continues.
Calling reform of the national security infrastructure "the number one national security issue," Locher said that America's
ability to operate in international arenas the world over is "crippled" by the dysfunction within the system.
He called the White House's national security staff "incredibly weak," preventing integration and coordination
that the National Security Council should be doing.
"There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president," Locher said,
adding, "We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system."
There's also no effective means for delegating the president's authority, he added.
Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy
chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons.
Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security
strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so.
The "Guiding Coalition" that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO
Norman Augustine, former Amb. Robert Blackwill, retired Gen. Wesley Clark, retired Adm. Ed Giambastiani, former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, plus Washington players Brent
Scowcroft, Thomas Pickering, and Joseph Nye.
Last November's version of the PNSR report included input from now Obama officials Jim Jones, James Steinberg,
Michele Flournoy, and Dennis Blair. It declared that "the national security of the United States of America is
fundamentally at risk."

WASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palin's qualified to be president, according to a
new national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey.
But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of the
public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's qualified for the Oval Office. That's more than Vice President Joe
Biden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.
According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the
former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.
The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she
isn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent
disagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.
The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, "Going Rogue: An American Life."
"The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP
nomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
According to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling
the same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63
percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of
Palin."
Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she
cares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy," says Holland. "But the perception that she is
not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel."An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday
indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.
The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,
17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's low
number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden
personally."
In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president," say
Holland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if
respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he
adds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the
administration grew more unpopular. "Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes toward
the Bush/Cheney administration did," he says.
Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,
the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,
Holland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - "which might explain why some
respondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep."
The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by
telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.

I'm writing in the hope that when you're in Afghanistan you will be able to demonstrate in some public way your support
for the Afghan women. There is much disillusionment over the aftermath of the elections and the ongoing violence. It
would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move
Afghanistan forward.
Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned.
I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in
Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.
Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the
talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming
ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if
he tapped women and so many are highly qualified.
Thanks.

I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again

We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.
Tomw, I will be speaking on this year's World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. There's so much potential
for India's economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if they'd tap women's potential here. India is last of the BRIC
countries on most indicators and comes out poorly generally. Will be raising some of these issues with govt in Dialogue

Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. I'm so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues.

November 09, 2009
Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

ill Ex-Gates Foundation exec named foreign aid chief
Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid
By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press
ij 11-10-2009 13:46
11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation
and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
$ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the
Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the officials said.
¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public
announcement of the choice.
11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership
vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his
campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy.
11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their
preferred "smart power" foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and
development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.
11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.
$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'
withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as
"ridiculous," "a nightmare," and "frustrating beyond words."
$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research,
Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget
of more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.
¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its
$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation's Global
Development program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.
The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset
development experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who
had already gone through the vetting process.
¶ Shah fits that bill and has important political credentials, having worked with or for several leading
Democratic politicians.

This evening cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed to Majority Leader Reid's health care bill, 60 to 39.
It was a straight party line vote. Despite some early concern over how they would vote, Senators Ben Nelson, Landrieu,
and Lincoln voted with the caucus. Each has warned they're not a guaranteed "yes" vote on final passage.
Senators voted from their seats, and Senator Dodd sat in the chair during the vote. The vote was followed by brief
applause.
Per the UC agreement negotiated by Reid and McConnell, this evening's cloture vote will also double as the vote on the
underlying motion to proceed, meaning the Senate will recess after the vote and will be on the health care bill when it
returns from the Thanksgiving recess.

FYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. Sid
Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's
links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a "contract" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this
week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories is
a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of "top slicing" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies "focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies".
There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the
licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing
any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company, Sky. "This
was done for News International," a Tory insider said yesterday. "Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.
He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened."
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.
Last summer James Murdoch attacked the "abysmal record" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see
the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its "total failure" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely
Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an "egregious" invasion of private enterprise by the state.
Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.
In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that "no
commercial competitor can afford". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,
promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.
Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had "effectively formed a contract, over
the head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: "What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is
one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the
other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed
up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit."
This was "absolutely, categorically" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord
Mandelson of talking "preposterous nonsense".
The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership, announced that it was
jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.
Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive
attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992
general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan "It was The Sun wot won it".
But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has
admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a
makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.
A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord
Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was "inappropriate" compared with 23 per
cent who thought it was "legitimate".
The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron
personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his
"cast-iron" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.
Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has
campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The
Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.
His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail, but in The
Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline "Cameron's crusade for UK rights".
The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun
virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he "regretted" his
son's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, "who is a friend of mine", but defended it on the grounds that Brown has
been a "disappointment".
Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving
the Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His
replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.
Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a
Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets
Negative Score In Key Swing State
Word format
For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.
In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.
Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.
"The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the
Governor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the
most important swing state in the country," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute.
"Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now
are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very
worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America."
Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.
"In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls," said Brown.
Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.
"None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were
winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether
it continues is anyone's guess," said Brown.
Ohio voters oppose Obama's health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a
61 - 35 percent margin, voters don't think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets
Democratic votes.
But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan.
Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent.
Afghanistan
The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters
support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S.
troops should be sent.
"But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan
for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has
said will be needed for victory," said Brown.
From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9
percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/-
4.9 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data or RSS feed- http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, call (203) 582-5201, or follow us
on Twitter.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is still in serious trouble in his re-election race with 53% of voters saying he does not
deserve re-election, a new Quinnipiac poll finds.
Connecticut voters disapprove, 54% to 40%, of the job Dodd is doing, compared to a 49% to 43% disapproval in
September.
In general election match ups, Dodd loses to both Rob Simmons (R), 49% to 38%, and to Linda McMahon (R), 43% to
41%.

Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wing
Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological and
partisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than
the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no
reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of
the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats
ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal
impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA
don't show up in the email but they are described. Sid

Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?
By Sean Trende
John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in
Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to
upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if
imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.
Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's
coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily
successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election
of the most liberal President in American History last year.
Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in
Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though
not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the
GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly
races by fewer than 1,000 votes.
There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is
too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness
among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their
Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in
elections.
But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of
the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic
coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.
The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:
Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began
breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and
liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.
But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,
urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a
moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a
combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation
for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the
Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by
eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.
Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call
someone "macaca," and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,
and are fans of "law and order." They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean
environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced
budgets are the ultimate "good government" indicator for these voters.
Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.
In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic
growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the "Carter" label for the Democrats. This,
in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -
one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.
George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,
a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more
heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,
major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put
together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.
The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.
But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the
stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama
received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.
Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the
remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with
vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were
enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black
President.
But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,
poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the
party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the
door, the party isn't left with much.
We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at
the counties that Mark Warner won.
The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the
mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites
in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,
but it worked.
Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:
The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area
becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,
and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in
during the 1920s.
As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than
Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the
Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at
least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia
changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:
The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward
Democrats.
We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC
suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton
Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in
2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the
ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.
We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's
compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at "relative movement." Because
everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing "movement" would be solid dark red, and not of
much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved
less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].
We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't
moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern
portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This
suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.
Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so
dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at "relative" shifts.
The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans
around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, "blue" in a relative map still
means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in
the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.
In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to
win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the
Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.
This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is
very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to
make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion
dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade
make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at
some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first
year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to
enact a net spending cut any more.
Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the
mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out
when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death
penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18
points, even holding everything else equal.
The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in
the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs
voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like
it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd
Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative
Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the
outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures
prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive
there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen
his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.
States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved
much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and
Senator, in classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of
course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.
This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other
factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls
to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to
show its downside for downticket Democrats.
The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find
themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.

The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
Amateur Hour at the White House
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm
The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his
foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.
President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's
limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of
the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama
should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in
decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.
Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's
most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism
and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade
problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.
A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized
Obama for not getting China to "throw its weight around." What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others
lamented that Obama couldn't make "demands" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and
that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,
and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama
continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach
this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and
alienating America's allies.
Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect "deliverables"
on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-
operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when
you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to
make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on
certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents
wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the
visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for
Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.
Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and
the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways
to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would
actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North
Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-
deserved vacation in Hawaii.
Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do
this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate
that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and
meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders
obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he
and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.
The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic
economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have
advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the
God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral
organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian
Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are
increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian
nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China
won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want
Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a
leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.
They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.
That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its
leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like
the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the
new Pacific Era.

H: If Roubini is right, and he's been mostly right so far, one of the few, then without additional and large stimulus
devoted to putting a floor on job loss, the pressure on protectionism will be far more intense. (Protectionism, by
any name, should not be dismissed as a targeted tool in an ongoing policy to force China to revalue its currency.
The US is not without means here.) The deficit will be high in any case and the Republicans will always attempt to
exploit it no matter what its number. Whether another stimulus can pass Congress is another matter. Still, what
matters in the short-run--and long-run--are achievable results. To most people, the deficit is an abstraction;
employment and housing--and insecurity about both--are their vital, concrete and immediate issues. Sid

15_the_worst_is_yet_to_come_unemployed_americans_should_hunker_down_for_more job_lo.html
The worst is yet to come: Unemployed
Americans should hunker down for more job
losses
BY Nouriel Roubini
Sunday, November 15th 2009, 4:00 AM
Think the worst is over? Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official
unemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged
workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.
While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more
than the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.
Also, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until
June of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.
So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed
and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic
numbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.
There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with
another round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments
and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending
unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.
The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as
a way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.
Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs
formally lost.
This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance
jobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other
countries.
Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job
applicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of
unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.
Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very
high level for two years or more.
The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an
anemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.
As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;
larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and
commercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate
mortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater
protectionist,pressures.
The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.

editorial
US fumbling for a new China tone
Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39
Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese on
everything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged
Barack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.
That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how
dependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.
It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and
the relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal
contradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.
The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling
for the right one. Take global imbalances.
In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not
abandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as
usual. "One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American
consumers and Asian exports to drive growth," he said.
That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly
sceptical about the US's long-term finances.
From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to
spend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.
That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for
healthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.
On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal
Reserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a
bit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of
gross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can
address a humbled superpower.
Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly
his decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.
His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-
oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.
When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its
chief creditor.
Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not "interfere" with matters of
implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo
speech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication
that Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr
Obama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not
undo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.
It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise
need not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common
perception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent
Chinese growth has been on the US consumer.
Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same
as Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and
must not — kowtow.

Council on Foreign Relations
Expert Brief
The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from Myths
Steven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow for International Economics
Author:
Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Author
of the Council Special Report, Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.
November 16, 2009
http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina
Many myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, and
it is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. The
fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United
States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.
imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have
emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in
China is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.
Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States
(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the
rebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,
President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in
China. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in
Pittsburgh in September 2009.
Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main "banker" for the United States
China holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that
70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the
United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other
willing public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the
U.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the
event that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.
Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the
reason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China
reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater
flexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its
economy and be able to sustain rapid growth.
China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to
finance its budget deficits.
If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official
reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its
purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.
In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.
dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an
appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by
China's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh
the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.
Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other
major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest
rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.
Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market
disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a
substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are
very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative
official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.
Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods
This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of
manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,
etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute
for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among
producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are
narrowing.
Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in
China is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009
owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this
objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.
Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.
The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.
The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While
no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there
is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo
because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in
China's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to
fixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.
Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China
Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects
on China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes
in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been
a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve
conditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of
migrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in
China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although China
accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from
other countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity
producers may be benefiting from China's strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world
economy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.
It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese
authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the
Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy, but this should be done in his private discussions
with China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more
effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other major
economies.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best
interest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward
greater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China
to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United
States and other major economies.

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech.
(Lincoln, in 1864, on Obama's plan: "The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it.")
Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks.
And last night in an special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC.
It was a hard fought race, in fact, and her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email
with the slogan: "She's Not Jackie."
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist
organization) and that will be published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined
By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack
Obama, "You lie!" during the president's nationally televised speech on healthcare,
the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the conservative
grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came
from the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a
href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-joe-wilson-member-
neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire
to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who
must apologize, not the one who identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-
enactors who spent their organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields
and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was substantially <a
href=http ://www. sp lcenter. org/inte l/intelreport/artic le .j sp?pid=1027 >taken
over</a> by an organized cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154 >here</a> for
more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society
into what the veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st
century Christian war machine capable of uniting the Confederate community and
leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive
list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to "hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=hftp://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored
dreams</a> of creating a seemingly benign front group for a more sophisticated
version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically, but,
sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a
German neo-Nazi magazine in 1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the
advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the robes and
hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization.'" With the SCV,
Lyons discovered he didn't have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV,
the organization's political newsletter, <a href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/
>The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor), transformed
into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying
members of the SCV — presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went
defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing blacks as genetically
inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned
that if Obama runs for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature"
would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated
the blacks, in perhaps the mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions.
The blacks — then a childlike people — had been selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for
$.25 apiece in national elections."
--"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury,
September/October 2003
"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among
the races; but at Columbia, a liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that
there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the only biological differences between the
blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the media heaped
special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical
of the black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly
competent people who were being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be
extremely anti-white and would demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative
action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who were seeking jobs or admission to
College and Graduate Schools."
--"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern
Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial
riots. If he were running for re-election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature
that would seriously damage race relations in America, and leave entire sections of some of our
cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's
takeover by open white supremacists began. But he didn't. Or he could have
withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist rag.
But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired
campaign in 2000 to keep the Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state
capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very honorable,"
Wilson <a href=http ://news. bbc . co .uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at
the time, responding to critics of the Confederate flag.
Wilson's rebel yell at Obama has electrified the Republican grassroots, filling his
campaign coffers with donations <a

the country and earning the undistinguished, previously unknown backbencher
primetime appearances on right-wing talk shows. Wilson has become the new voice
of the Republican opposition, reigniting the Lost Cause as a raucous crusade to
sabotage healthcare reform.

Just following up on a few items.
First, see below on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Third, on QME, Gates and Barak are meeting the week of UNGA and we are holding until then if you are comfortable
with that.
Fourth, Declan Kelly is going to be in Belfast Monday and Tuesday with Lou Susman. I will be there Tuesday for all of the
official meetings. Declan and I will stay Tuesday night after Lou leaves and have dinner with a broad cross-section of
folks.
Fifth, I'm working with Holbrooke's and Lew's shops on the materials for Af/Pak, and we'll have a concept paper over
the weekend on the UNGA curtain raiser.
Sixth, Mike Fuchs and I met with Team WHA on Mexico, following up on Carlos' memo. Mike is working with WHA to
ensure that we create a productive agenda and outcomes for the Merida meeting you will participate in at UNGA.
(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of
our Embassies have been able to confirm local media reports.

Madam Secretary,
Thank you so much. It is very exciting to finally see the book in print (when I first got a copy I was almost afraid to look
inside it!). I hope you enjoy it. And yes, I have been working with Lissa and others on the democracy/human rights
speech.
On the question about UK soldiers - the UK lost more soldiers in the Falklands than they have in Afghanistan:
255 in the Falklands
235 in Afghanistan (including British forces personnel and MOD civilians)
Please let me know if you would like any other information on that.
Again, thank you so much, and Happy Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Mike

Here is rasmussen statement at press conf today:
On behalf of NATO, I warmly welcome President Obama's announcement on the new US approach and commitment to
the mission in Afghanistan. President Obama's decision to substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the NATO-
led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for success. The
United States' contribution to the NATO-led mission has always been substantial; it is now even more important.But this
is not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO have shared the risks, costs and burdens of this mission from the
beginning. As the US increases its commitment, I am confident that the other Allies, as well as our Partners in the
mission, will also make a substantial increase in their contribution. Taken together, the new force contributions from
across the Alliance, as well as the new approach agreed by all the ISAF countries, will help create a new momentum in
the mission in 2010.

FortAgn Policy
Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom
The State Department suffers from low morale, bottlenecks, and bureaucratic ineptitude. Do we need to kill it to save it?
BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009
Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles
of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.
Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-
century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide
range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has
changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most
pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after
report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to
respond to the new 21st-century paradigm.
But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and
reassign the pieces?
There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its "core missions" of
traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found
that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a
bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,
the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including
"today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria," the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the
Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership
in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers
capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.
By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on
Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department
now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for
example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State
Department's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs.
Further, rivalries between the different "cones" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the "conal caste system"
-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau
noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a "failed office" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.
Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership "does not understand public diplomacy." The sentiment is
widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,
described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional
discrimination against those in the career track.
Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human
and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its
bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike
Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is
so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If
there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean
it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.
The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such
luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the "expanding
role of the military in U.S. foreign policy." He said he was concerned by the "migration of functions and authorities from
U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense."
Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy
it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public
diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --
could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.
But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.
The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the
U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.
Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one
hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This "Department of State
and Non-State" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and
upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid
hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.
Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow
authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries
and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to
oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the
regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.
Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would
help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense
Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regional
leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These
changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for
today's requirements.
But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a
bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growing
power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more
importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.
In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for the
State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight
years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed
cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and
implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The
United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president
whose entire election platform was built around the word "change," and an American public that would be outraged at
the dysfunction if it only knew the details.

Per the plan, a statement is being released in your name. This is the same statement you saw in the memo package
from Mitchell:
Today's announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the
conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed
swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments
and meet Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to
achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering.

Netanyahu gave a press conference a few hours ago. I've seen plenty of his quotes in stories. Let me see if I can find
transcript.

Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.
It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal
life over the time period of the suspension.
Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens
will also be provided during this time.
Regarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our
sovereign capital.
As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all
the city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike.
When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to
construction.
I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace
process forward. There is no more time to waste.
Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.

I didn't - but hard to believe he did. I was pretty surprised myself when I read the piece.
Just shows you that it's near impossible to take issue with the job you're doing it, which is why the political reporters
have to resort to the manufactured drama of interactions with the WH.
Face was good. Perfect in that it generated no issues to clean up, but other networks picked up clips re Iran.
Gates's remark that he couldn't send any new troops before January to Afghanistan seems to be the only thing
approaching news.

Jake, Want to make sure you saw the front page story below. It's really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained at
Guantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U.S. a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most of
the world (although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. Toribiong re this was a good
move right after Alcy upset the Palauans (as you feared) in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately. Jeff
2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo
To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family
By Del Quentin Wilber
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, September 28, 2009
Bahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the
Pacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.
It should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the
surprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can
look after his older brother, a fellow detainee.
The brothers' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of
Guantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a
Jan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties
facing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the
United States.
The brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of
the United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United
States launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Since at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.
Five went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering
the possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most
countries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China.
In recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice
Department.
The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed
mental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his
attorney, Elizabeth Gilson.
To make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went
searching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.
"This is just very difficult and sad," said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006
who considers himself a friend of both brothers.
"Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother," Qasim said through an interpreter. "His brother is only there
because of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them."
Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan
Baker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.
The earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says.
Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to
comment or did not return phone messages.
In 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small
house in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were
not particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and
ensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar
sold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.
Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly
ran out of money and couldn't find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him
about a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted "to fight against the Chinese government."
"If I went," he told military officials, "I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan."
There, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group
built houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other
calisthenics, records show.
Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and
told Arkin to find his brother. "He left because he was a dutiful son," Gilson said.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar's camp,
sending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,
where they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.
Meanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned
over the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.
In 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the
time that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later
dissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.
Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter
working for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an
interrogation room.
When they saw each other, they hugged and wept. "It was just so emotional," Abbas said. "These brothers from
across the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time."
In 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been
disrespectful to the guards, records show.
Not for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was
granted a request to be moved to Arkin's camp. "I missed my brother so much," he told military officials.
By the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any
evidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a
judge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are
awaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.
Last year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games
and books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to
come. "I know I'll die in here," Arkin told Gilson not long ago. "In China, at least I would have a trial and
sentence."
Since taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar
by phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered
fruitless legal victories.
Two weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau's
generous offer. "Every day here is an eternity," he told Gilson through an interpreter. "But I have to look out for
my brother."

FW: Friday Presentation on Urgent Threat - Bill Burns will not be at the Retreat
 --- 

He indicated he will not be back until Friday night or Saturday am -- are you saying postpone the entire Retreat?
 --- 

Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.
The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.
I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.
I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.
Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.
Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.

new Iran-China oil deal, reported in Iran (in English) and in China (in Chinese)
B6B6
Secretary Clinton,
Just wanted to make sure that you saw the news about one of China's oil conglomerates and the Iranian National Oil
Company over the
weekend:
Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed
a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese
company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne,
Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers
a 90 percent stake in the project.
A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this
information in English at this time is worth considering.
The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources
with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though):

Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal
Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the
development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.
The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in
Lausanne, Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)
that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.
CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project
with NICO holding 20 percent, and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.
The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost
around $2.5 billion.
The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's
largest finds in the last 30 years.
Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.
The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after
development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.
China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran
over its peaceful nuclear program.

Afghan speech below
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office
Phone: 202.224.6221
Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to "live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success." The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces "is our goal."
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops "is absolutely our Achilles heel."
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the "Sons of Iraq." They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution."
But this "game changing" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: "Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests."
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.

H: Of interest, Hague latest briefing, hostile to Tony. Tories desperately do not want Blair there, want to run their own
European policy, mostly anti-EU, and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe. Tory Party split, with anti-EU
faction dominant, its base virulent, and Cameron straddling as best he can. Hague leans anti-Europe. S
London Times
October 22, 2009
`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a "declaration of war"
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was "a bit strong". Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a "clear mark of hostility".
"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy
involved in the creation of the position in the first place," Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his
fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.
Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the
Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European
parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,
led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya"s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for
the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique
opportunity to promote that vital mission.

The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that

But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million

Rajiv Shah
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Current Under Secretary Rajiv Shah
Rajiv "Raj" Shah (born March 9, 1973) is presently Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education,
and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture.
Prior to his appointment at USDA, Shah worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Financial Services, leader of the
Strategic Opportunities initiative and manager of the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine
Fund. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the
global system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this
facility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential
campaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.
Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and
also attended the London School of Economics.
President Obama announced Shah's selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and
Chief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shah's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous
consent on May 12, 2009.
Early life and family
Born to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60's, Raj Shah grew up in the
Detroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School.
He lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah,
who is a medical doctor.
Career
Raj Shah is currently the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The REE mission area provides the science that federal agencies, policy
makers, researchers, and others draw on to meet challenges facing America's food and agriculture system. The
four REE agencies are the Agricultural Research Service (including the National Agricultural Library), the
Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service.
Prior to his appointment at USDA Raj worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation to help the poorest people on earth lead healthy and productive lives.
As the Director of the Agricultural Development program, Shah oversaw the foundation's multi-billion dollar
portfolio of grant and program-related investments to help transform rural economies throughout the developing
world and help small farmers and their families overcome hunger and poverty. He led efforts to create the
Alliancefor a Green Revolution in Africa, helped recruit its leadership including UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and serves on its Board of Directors. He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer
productivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60
professionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World
Bank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and
hunger.
As the Foundation's first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad
range of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the
field's collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation
co-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the
Foundation's Global Development Program.
Shah's early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance,
Raj managed the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and
Melinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for
Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of
more than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more
than five million children's lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as
"a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future."
Shah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active
supporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor
Ed Rendell's health transition committee. He also co-founded Health Systems Analytics (a health care
consulting firm), served as an advisor to the City of Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, and worked at
the World Health Organization. In addition, he co-founded multiple nonprofit organizations focused on
increasing the political awareness and civic engagement of minority communities, including Project Impact for
South Asian Americans.

EU leaders to debate Blair presidency on
summit sidelines
Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president
European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the
divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.
The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and
how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior
diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get
the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for
summits at least four times a year.
David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a "strong voice" on the global stage, but his
comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved
that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.
Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair
personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the
former prime minister's behalf.
"We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals," said an
official. "There is only one candidate."
That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the
only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.
Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed
as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.
While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the
meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.
While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on "almost everything".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president "from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises."
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.

Editorial
Diplomacy 101
We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled
special envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel
violence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.
Nine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.
The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, and
President Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.
Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be
farther off than ever.
Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one
move down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel's
commitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no.
Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace
talks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political
advisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)
The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start
negotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.
Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and
permits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond
what past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the
compromise.
Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially
Saudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel
to fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.
Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.
All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic
performance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?
The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence
of a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way
forward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.

We commend the Honduran people for having exercised peacefully their democratic, sovereign and inalienable right to

We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of

A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan
President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his
administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the
meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not
describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests
that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to
Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.
Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical
nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and
timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about
30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speech,
as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that
the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe
that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he
would not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition
from Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the
stability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has
proven elusive.

Jonathan Powell suggests that VVJC write an article supporting Tony Blair for EU president in Die Welt, the Berlin
newspaper. If so, I suggest it be wrapped in a discussion on the future of Europe, the need for Europe to be strong as a
partner with US for many goals requiring a strong president: the policy imperatives, from climate change, security, social
integration, etc. point to Blair. Also, if done, should include description and endorsement of Blair's personal Qualities for
office. Can't be backhanded. Jonathan says Tony should call Bill soon. Sid

Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks
Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him
• Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels
• u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT
T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances
of success were "fading" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post.
Hours after G
.nr.4,
,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him
earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job.
"it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading," one British source said."..slcgles. t.
..aa'r.sa; and are
not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer."
Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et.,
.."it;ity.n-te was emerging
as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted,
however, that.he was "not available".
Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become
president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU
country to ratify the Lisbon treaty.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the
Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which
brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.
Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his
predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. "Of course it may not happen and there are other
candidates as well," he said.
The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this
afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.
Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the
European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.
Brown told the meeting: "You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the
president of the council."
But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left
across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to
work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said
the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. "There is a preference for the high
representative," he said. "That is rather reasonable."
A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had "dropped Blair" and that the centre-left in the EU
was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the
centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,
Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. "lt is
not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a
new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next
generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair."
Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had
become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.
Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure
such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be
pleased by the strength of his successor's support.
Brown said today: "Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent
candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.
"His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to
everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in
Britain's national interest."

Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in Pakistan
NEW YORK TIMES
October 30, 2009
Hillary Rodham Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrived,
extremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nation
newspaper dismissed the visit as a mere "PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine,
beyond the already compliant government."
Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washington
for using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington for
pressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The fact
that many of the extremists are on Pakistan's territory and threatening Pakistan's government has not shifted that
thinking or mitigated that resentment.
A good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistan's government, which has still not adequately explained that this is
not just America's fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled the
Pakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.
Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined to
use this visit to also broaden the relationship.
Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held
talks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious college
students; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;
and visited religious and cultural sights.
She promised to refocus American aid on the "needs of the people" and announced targeted commitments, including
$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricity
project aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.
Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid
package approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanis
that, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment.
The Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabad
was consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civilian
control of the military.
If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself.
And it is going to have to insist that Pakistan's leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the real
benefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clinton's trip was an important start — but only a start.

Only Palau & Israel vote w/US in UN

Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a
resolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two
other states in free association with the US. did not support the US position. important officials
in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in.U.S. assistance that Alcy Frelick has
insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in
assistance pledged to the two other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also
misinformed and misguided.

Sorry -- just seeing. In short, they might have made a bad word choice. They should have said "reconcile" instead of

leverage to push it through with BN. Can elaborate on plane.
They didn't admit they made a bad word choice - that's my interpretation.
