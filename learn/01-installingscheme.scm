;Why Scheme?

;By Using Scheme:
;*You can write beautiful programs.
;*You can enjoy programming.

;These are the only reasons to learn Scheme. You will find some difficulties if you write practical applications using Scheme.

;However, as excellent hackers favor Scheme, it is worth learning the language. In fact, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) — one of the best textbook on computer science — uses Scheme to describe programs. GNU also uses Scheme (named guile) for a common script language for its applications. The guile corresponds to a macro for MS-Word or Excell. It is used to manupulate applications with a simple script.

;Even Common Lisp is better for building practical applications, I recommend to learn Scheme first because of its
;*compact language design and
;*simple syntax.

;It is said that Scheme makes you better programmer. Even you seldom use Scheme for your business, the good sense provided by learning Scheme will guide you even if you use other programming languages.

;Scheme tutorials in the web (so many as Scheme is popular language) are somehow difficult for beginners. This tutorial, on the other hand, is written for beginner programmers and little knowledge on programming is required.
