"When it comes to foreign policy, all see you doing a great job. You must be literally killing yourself— I can see your
schedule is bruising. But you probably need more strategy time, less events as the ultimate judgment will be on •
whether iran, nk get the bomb, progress in Mideast, success in Afghanistan, Iraq. Obama's pause on Afghanistan goes
well with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it is
making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries — any
decision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan, rest is secondary at this point.
That's my view for what it's worth. Take care.

Dear Phil, Jim and Richard,
First, Happy Thanksgiving! I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the
specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.
Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us.
/Let me know what you each think. Thx.
Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the
historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion
is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the
Bush era.
Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his
accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate
his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was
a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true.
The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion,
has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings
will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an
enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the
Afghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held.
Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK
diplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all
British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and
journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.
Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most
resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration
is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.
Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager
to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the
contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative
government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's
daughter, Margaret Thatcher.
And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down,
the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,
Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories.
The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan
process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See
the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.
Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in
Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to
Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment
should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.
Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article.
From The Times
November 26, 2009
Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and
attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that "the whole world" had a responsibility
to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the "obligations of our international partners".
Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his
advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and
has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the
Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a
separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.
Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number
requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.
It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama
Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not
seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion
that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the
anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot
be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato
campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these
growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply
unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as
possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is
already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the
persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the
main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically
understood on both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and
political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in
investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies
have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his
election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has
certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic
relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But
until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was
stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is
enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all

Madame Secretary:
Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.
I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.
Regards,
Tom

In a series of short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne "in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the "Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: "These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?"
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone "from the
Jewish side" apologised for how "the Jews" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. "If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne," he said, "you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland."
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to "Jewish actions" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: "it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us." Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: "I
should apologise?"
But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent "smears" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the "federalist" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in
Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated
Nicholas',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.
c.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of "castrating" Britain's position within the EU by
adopting an "autistic" approach that would take Britain off the radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as "pathetic" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed "for a minute".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness and regret" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a "bizarre
autism" in their discussions.
He said: "They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism."
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Caii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate "bust-up" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesman
in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become "self-governing".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result
of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short." He said Cameron's approach
was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which
Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament," he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a "waste of time for all of us".
"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us," the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. "It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.
It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that," he said. "It is a time of tumultuous waters all
around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time
when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fighting
it out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate".
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of
course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That
should tell you quite a bit huh?" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short
term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke
cries, of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
"That is not how we are seen across Europe," he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
"1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals," he added.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World
By Joe Klein
Time Magazine
Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE
UPI Editor at Large
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., the
Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire
against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,
because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan
experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least
not significantly.
The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times
over the last eight years, replete with terrorist "trainees" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy
pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.
Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.
11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of
Pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient
maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's "martyrs" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,
to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.
Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in
Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's
where al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to
Pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted
Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now
insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal
areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are
widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.
As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is
doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals
will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial
towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will
do/are doing it.
Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs
compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which
has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central
issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.
If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of "no more Sept. lls," what are the United
States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the
Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was
palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was
issuing "too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious
education." Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power
and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.
In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen
has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort
has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many
others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a
Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All
requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY
was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese
ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.
The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY
and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.
Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost
reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not
disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that
reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.
If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to
fight the Afghan government.
The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These
are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the
military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and
Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after
authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.
In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.

Report: Obama's national security team
'incredibly weak'
Wed, 11/04/2009 - 1:45pm
Despite an expansion of the National Security Council staff, coordination of national security policy is still dysfunctional
and there is a lack of strategic guidance from President Obama, according to a group of leading outside experts and
former officials.
"Reform must take place," said dames Lalher, President & CEO of the r!-olect on n; alone! Security Reform (PNSR), If
you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... you're not going to like what's coming in the future."
"Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions," reads PNSR's .new report . The
congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "Strategic management of the national security system remains absent
and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile," the report continues.
Calling reform of the national security infrastructure "the number one national security issue," Locher said that America's
ability to operate in international arenas the world over is "crippled" by the dysfunction within the system.
He called the White House's national security staff "incredibly weak," preventing integration and coordination
that the National Security Council should be doing.
"There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president," Locher said,
adding, "We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system."
There's also no effective means for delegating the president's authority, he added.
Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy
chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons.
Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security
strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so.
The "Guiding Coalition" that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO
Norman Augustine, former Amb. Robert Blackwill, retired Gen. Wesley Clark, retired Adm. Ed Giambastiani, former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, plus Washington players Brent
Scowcroft, Thomas Pickering, and Joseph Nye.
Last November's version of the PNSR report included input from now Obama officials Jim Jones, James Steinberg,
Michele Flournoy, and Dennis Blair. It declared that "the national security of the United States of America is
fundamentally at risk."

WASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palin's qualified to be president, according to a
new national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey.
But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of the
public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's qualified for the Oval Office. That's more than Vice President Joe
Biden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.
According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the
former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.
The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she
isn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent
disagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.
The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, "Going Rogue: An American Life."
"The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP
nomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
According to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling
the same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63
percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of
Palin."
Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she
cares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy," says Holland. "But the perception that she is
not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel."An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday
indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.
The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,
17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's low
number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden
personally."
In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president," say
Holland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if
respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he
adds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the
administration grew more unpopular. "Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes toward
the Bush/Cheney administration did," he says.
Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,
the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,
Holland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - "which might explain why some
respondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep."
The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by
telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.

I'm writing in the hope that when you're in Afghanistan you will be able to demonstrate in some public way your support
for the Afghan women. There is much disillusionment over the aftermath of the elections and the ongoing violence. It
would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move
Afghanistan forward.
Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned.
I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in
Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.
Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the
talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming
ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if
he tapped women and so many are highly qualified.
Thanks.

I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again

We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.
Tomw, I will be speaking on this year's World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. There's so much potential
for India's economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if they'd tap women's potential here. India is last of the BRIC

Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. I'm so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues.

November 09, 2009
Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

ill Ex-Gates Foundation exec named foreign aid chief
Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid
By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press
ij 11-10-2009 13:46
11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation
and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
$ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the
Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the officials said.
¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public
announcement of the choice.
11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership
vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his
campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy.
11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their
preferred "smart power" foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and
development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.
11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.
$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'

FYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. Sid
Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's
links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a "contract" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this
week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories is
a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of "top slicing" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies "focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies".
There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the
licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing
any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company, Sky. "This
was done for News International," a Tory insider said yesterday. "Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.
He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened."
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.
Last summer James Murdoch attacked the "abysmal record" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see
the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its "total failure" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely
Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an "egregious" invasion of private enterprise by the state.
Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.
In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that "no
commercial competitor can afford". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,
promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.
Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had "effectively formed a contract, over
the head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: "What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is
one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the
other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed
up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit."
This was "absolutely, categorically" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord
Mandelson of talking "preposterous nonsense".
The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership, announced that it was
jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.
Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive
attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992
general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan "It was The Sun wot won it".
But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has
admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a
makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.
A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord
Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was "inappropriate" compared with 23 per
cent who thought it was "legitimate".
The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron
personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his
"cast-iron" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.
Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has
campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The
Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.
His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail, but in The
Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline "Cameron's crusade for UK rights".
The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun
virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he "regretted" his
son's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, "who is a friend of mine", but defended it on the grounds that Brown has
been a "disappointment".
Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving
the Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His
replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.
Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a
Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets
Negative Score In Key Swing State
Word format
For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.
In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.
Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.
"The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the
Governor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the
most important swing state in the country," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute.
"Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now
are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very
worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America."
Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.
"In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls," said Brown.
Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.
"None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were
winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether
it continues is anyone's guess," said Brown.
Ohio voters oppose Obama's health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a
61 - 35 percent margin, voters don't think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets
Democratic votes.
But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan.
Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent.
Afghanistan
The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters
support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S.
troops should be sent.
"But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan
for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has
said will be needed for victory," said Brown.
From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9
percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/-
4.9 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data or RSS feed- http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, call (203) 582-5201, or follow us
on Twitter.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is still in serious trouble in his re-election race with 53% of voters saying he does not
deserve re-election, a new Quinnipiac poll finds.
Connecticut voters disapprove, 54% to 40%, of the job Dodd is doing, compared to a 49% to 43% disapproval in
September.
In general election match ups, Dodd loses to both Rob Simmons (R), 49% to 38%, and to Linda McMahon (R), 43% to
41%.

Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wing
Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological and
partisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than
the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no
reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of
the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats
ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal
impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA
don't show up in the email but they are described. Sid

Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?
By Sean Trende
John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in
Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to
upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if
imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.
Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's
coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily
successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election
of the most liberal President in American History last year.
Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in
Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though
not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the
GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly
races by fewer than 1,000 votes.
There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is
too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness
among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their
Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in
elections.
But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of
the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic
coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.
The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:
Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began
breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and
liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.
But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,
urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a
moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a
combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation
for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the
Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by
eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.
Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call
someone "macaca," and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,
and are fans of "law and order." They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean
environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced
budgets are the ultimate "good government" indicator for these voters.
Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.
In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic
growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the "Carter" label for the Democrats. This,
in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -
one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.
George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,
a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more
heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,
major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put
together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.
The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.
But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the
stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama
received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.
Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the
remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with
vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were
enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black
President.
But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,
poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the
party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the
door, the party isn't left with much.
We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at
the counties that Mark Warner won.
The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the
mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites
in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,
but it worked.
Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:
The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area
becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,
and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in
during the 1920s.
As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than
Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the
Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at
least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia
changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:
The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward
Democrats.
We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC
suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton
Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in
2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the
ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.
We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's
compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at "relative movement." Because
everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing "movement" would be solid dark red, and not of
much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved
less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].
We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't
moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern
portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This
suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.
Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so
dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at "relative" shifts.
The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans
around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, "blue" in a relative map still
means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in
the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.
In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to
win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the
Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.
This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is
very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to
make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion
dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade
make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at
some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first
year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to
enact a net spending cut any more.
Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the
mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out
when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death
penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18
points, even holding everything else equal.
The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in
the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs
voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like
it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd
Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative
Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the
outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures
prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive
there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen
his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.
States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved
much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and
Senator, in classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of
course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.
This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other
factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls
to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to
show its downside for downticket Democrats.
The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find
themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.

The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
Amateur Hour at the White House
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm
The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his
foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.
President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's
limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of
the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama
should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in
decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.
Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's
most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism
and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade
problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.
A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized
Obama for not getting China to "throw its weight around." What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others
lamented that Obama couldn't make "demands" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and
that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,
and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama
continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach
this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and
alienating America's allies.
Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect "deliverables"
on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-
operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when
you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to
make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on
certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents
wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the
visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for
Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.
Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and
the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways
to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would
actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North
Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-
deserved vacation in Hawaii.
Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do
this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate
that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and
meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders
obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he
and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.
The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic
economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have
advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the
God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral
organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian
Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are
increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian
nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China
won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want
Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a
leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.
They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.
That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its
leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like
the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the
new Pacific Era.

H: If Roubini is right, and he's been mostly right so far, one of the few, then without additional and large stimulus
devoted to putting a floor on job loss, the pressure on protectionism will be far more intense. (Protectionism, by
any name, should not be dismissed as a targeted tool in an ongoing policy to force China to revalue its currency.
The US is not without means here.) The deficit will be high in any case and the Republicans will always attempt to
exploit it no matter what its number. Whether another stimulus can pass Congress is another matter. Still, what
matters in the short-run--and long-run--are achievable results. To most people, the deficit is an abstraction;
employment and housing--and insecurity about both--are their vital, concrete and immediate issues. Sid

15_the_worst_is_yet_to_come_unemployed_americans_should_hunker_down_for_more job_lo.html
The worst is yet to come: Unemployed
Americans should hunker down for more job
losses
BY Nouriel Roubini
Sunday, November 15th 2009, 4:00 AM
Think the worst is over? Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official
unemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged
workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.
While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more
than the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.
Also, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until
June of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.
So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed
and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic
numbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.
There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with
another round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments
and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending
unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.
The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as
a way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.
Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs
formally lost.
This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance
jobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other
countries.
Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job
applicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of
unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.
Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very
high level for two years or more.
The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an
anemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.
As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;
larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and
commercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate
mortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater
protectionist,pressures.
The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.
Roubini is professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and Chairman of Roubini
Global Economics.

editorial
US fumbling for a new China tone
Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39
Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese on
everything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged
Barack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.
That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how
dependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.
It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and
the relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal
contradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.
The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling
for the right one. Take global imbalances.
In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not
abandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as
usual. "One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American
consumers and Asian exports to drive growth," he said.
That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly
sceptical about the US's long-term finances.
From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to
spend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.
That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for
healthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.
On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal
Reserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a
bit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of
gross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can
address a humbled superpower.
Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly
his decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.
His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-
oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.
When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its
chief creditor.
Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not "interfere" with matters of
implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo
speech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication
that Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr
Obama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not
undo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.
It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise
need not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common
perception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent
Chinese growth has been on the US consumer.
Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same
as Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and
must not — kowtow.

Council on Foreign Relations
Expert Brief
The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from Myths
Steven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow for International Economics
Author:
Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Author
of the Council Special Report, Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.
November 16, 2009
http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina
Many myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, and
it is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. The
fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United
States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.
imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have
emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in
China is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.
Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States
(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the
rebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,
President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in
China. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in
Pittsburgh in September 2009.
Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main "banker" for the United States
China holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that
70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the
United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other
willing public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the
U.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the
event that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.
Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the
reason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China
reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater
flexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its
economy and be able to sustain rapid growth.
China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to
finance its budget deficits.
If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official
reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its
purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.
In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.
dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an
appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by
China's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh
the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.
Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other
major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest
rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.
Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market
disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a
substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are
very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative
official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.
Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods
This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of
manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,
etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute
for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among
producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are
narrowing.
Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in
China is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009
owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this
objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.
Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.
The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.
The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While
no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there
is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo
because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in
China's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to
fixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.
Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China
Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects
on China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes
in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been
a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve
conditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of
migrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in
China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although China
accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from
other countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity
producers may be benefiting from China's strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world
economy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.
It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese
authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the
Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy, but this should be done in his private discussions
with China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more
effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other major
economies.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best
interest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward
greater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China
to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United
States and other major economies.

Per the plan, a statement is being released in your name. This is the same statement you saw in the memo package
from Mitchell:
Today's announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the
conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed
swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments
and meet Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to
achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering.

Netanyahu gave a press conference a few hours ago. I've seen plenty of his quotes in stories. Let me see if I can find
transcript.
 --- 

Will do.
 --- 

Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.
It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal
life over the time period of the suspension.
Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens
will also be provided during this time.
Regarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our
sovereign capital.
As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all
the city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike.
When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to
construction.
I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace
process forward. There is no more time to waste.
Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya"s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for
the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique
opportunity to promote that vital mission.

With your permission, we are changing the statement to spokesman's name rather than yours. Makes it a more generic
statement of U.S. policy and holds you in reserve.
We have tweaked the first paragraph to make clear our expectation.
On Mexico, consensus is that a call is worthwhile, but we will get you an updated call sheet that accounts for intervening
events.
The remaining Honduras related call sheets are also coming your way.
Please let me know if I can help with anything else.

Editorial
Diplomacy 101
We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled
special envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel
violence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.
Nine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.
The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, and
President Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.
Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be
farther off than ever.
Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one
move down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel's
commitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no.
Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace
talks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political
advisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)
The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start
negotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.
Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and
permits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond
what past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the
compromise.
Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially
Saudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel
to fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.
Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.
All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic
performance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?
The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence
of a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way
forward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.

The team proposes to put out the following statement in Ian's name tonight. We are weighing a recommendation to put
out a statement in your name tomorrow.
We commend the Honduran people for having exercised peacefully their democratic, sovereign and inalienable right to
select their leaders. The apparently large and enthusiastic turnout shows that given the opportunity to express
themselves, the Honduran people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in
their country.
We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of
the Honduran people in helping advance national reconciliation and the implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose
Accord. Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras, but today the
Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward.

A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan
President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his
administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the
meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not
describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests
that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to
Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.
Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical
nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and
timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about
30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speech,
as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that
the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe
that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he
would not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition
from Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the
stability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has
proven elusive.
