Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>
Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
"Hard Rock is the right balance," [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. "Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it."
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream ("shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award.")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-
01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as
reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know, as chief of US
mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head
of UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months
there. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of
increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks
there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace
Karzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with
Holbrooke, not because he can't reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is
on a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you
can reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today:
"The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare
public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W.
Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide.
"Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized
to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it
could undermine national stability.
Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of
polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide
and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could
be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin."

HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah
About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.
The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun
went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, "I shot a
man." It just happened.
I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,
Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party
who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own
success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.
The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,
unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of
powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the
murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter
how well armed, never felt it.
Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various
Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.
They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and
damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of
course that is frightening.
But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John
Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.
strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.
Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those
of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the
power that they wish to exert.
Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the
network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to
Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected
to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of
tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have
committed.
Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did
he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in
New Orleans where Republicans "wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have
impeccable taste in silk stockings" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--
both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good
evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered
hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).
This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A
Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he
wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was "saved," for example, he said, "My goal is to get to
heaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way." He must have
thought getting to heaven was just another power play.
And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that
Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,
whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.
At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the
strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going
after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in "the most vicious fight ever staged
between man and beast." As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until "he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent." In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,
over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.
It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal
cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric
Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these
powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.
The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons
about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he
surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame
and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the
hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.
Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by
liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his
thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been
interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how
constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I
think he looks within, and says, "I'm okay; you're okay." That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell
by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--
atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have
sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.
But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no
sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try
to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming
to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can
be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,
too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror
can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is
defined as powerless. When he "crumples" on the "loving" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who
administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his
powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.
That's where your freedom and mine come in.
Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban
only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never
share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply
hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.
It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide
of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,
and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In
his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for "disobedient children, unchaste
women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers," and homosexuals. Gary North, the
Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death
penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a
factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you
and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept
responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we "crumple" on his
"loving" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian
Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is "Adore me or I will hurt you."
Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,
thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical
punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
between man and beast." As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until "he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent." In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,

punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the
parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with
horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and
two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a God
who was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.
The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically
unstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing
about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-
VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us "back from the
brink" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they
would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is
that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,
Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and
Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler
didn't have nuclear weapons.
I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably
had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as
separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that
were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he
wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.

Am about to fax %roll the latest draft. There is still some litigating going on over Iran language, but hopefully we can
resolve it by later tonight. In any case, it's pretty far along. I'll try to do one more polish through it. Just be advised that I
n lay need to give you a clean draft overnight or early in the morning. Thx.

.... for terrific talk and discussion. Your robust statement on missile
defense was the best so far. As for your robust push-back on the premise
of my healthcare question, I didn't mean to imply that the Clinton
administration's foreign policy agenda suffered back then—rather, that
there's jeopardy to the Obama administration's foreign policy if the
current debate/fight turns out badly. But you mooted the whole thing by
reassuring us that all will turn out okay.
Anyway, I've taken an aspirin — and thank you profoundly for a great
event, and, of course, for the gracious personal touches.

Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's
my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's
allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he
inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to
counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in
the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets
that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-
range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's
ally Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few
long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an
immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces
stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range
Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm
should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible
one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there
suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used
offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario
was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However,
by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has
improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in
Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -
that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,
given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track
for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of
eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a
stark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being
vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the
other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be
on hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.
American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially
sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive
capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a
series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were
expected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.
While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan
was not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based
comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual
deterrence — "impotent and obsolete."
Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was
an impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program
with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.
The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the
START process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national
missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in
Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large
measure about "pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD."
Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied
arms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and
regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last
week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own
merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights
with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the
principles of the ABM treaty.
Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating
strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be
either impossible or, worse, dangerous.

Don't think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event:
TO: Secretary Clinton
FROM: Chris Falvo
DATE: September 8, 2009
RE: NY Local Issues
Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that
opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when
Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have
met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last
month.
H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant
portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is
that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so
instead they are asking sick kids to stay home.
And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.
Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.
Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been
closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for
Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.
Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. "Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' "
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
"Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing," he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. "What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period," he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

Having a # before makes a sham of the meeting. Palau has rejected the # & wouldn't accept it even if the Pres. did. He
won't because it would deplete Trust Fund by 2024 or so altho it is to last thru 2044 term of base rights, forcing Palau to

Seems the best for a bad situation.
Moves the public discussion from settlement freeze to final status. Keeps some pressure on the parties. And seems like you will play a
more public role, which is good. (You have more credibility on both sides than anyone).
Going forward, if Bibi continues to be the obstacle, you will need to fmd the ground from which you can make his politics uneasy. I
think you can do that even with current concerns in Israel about US posture. But it will be easier as we rebuild trust so that our future
admonitions are accepted. (An HRC trip there to reframe perceptions?).
Finally, need to be mindful of Abu Mazen's politics. Taking a lot of criticism for meeting with Bibi without settlement freeze.

Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private
talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting

London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers
Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: "I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen."
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: "In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable."
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting "the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. "I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution."
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. "My sight is not at all
deteriorating," he told NBC.
Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: "I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge."
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: "The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect."
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed "the terror council".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: "I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles."
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: "If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations."
He added: "If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially."
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh."

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left "the special relationship"
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone," the source said.
"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off."
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
"spend all day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.
Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute "walk and chat" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate "bilateral"
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must "move in a new direction" and "embrace20a
new era of engagement". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
? The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
? While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
? "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
? There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left
the room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
? Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
? "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
? Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she
depicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
? Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
? "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
? "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
? After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident." [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
? "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
? On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin." [Branch, 92]
? In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
? On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
? Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
? On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance." [Branch, 554]
? WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
? He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
? WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would
tarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
? Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
? The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'"
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice
president, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
"surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch,
644-45]
Other
? Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking
Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet,
and efficient." [Branch, 161]
> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,
342-343]
> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had
subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the
subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
? Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our
glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as
lighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]
> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their
best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al
would ever do it.'" [Branch, 540]
> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."
[Branch, 557]
? On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard
intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses
the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.
DI 'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She
winced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first
lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech.
(Lincoln, in 1864, on Obama's plan: "The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it.")
Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks.
And last night in an special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC.
It was a hard fought race, in fact, and her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email
with the slogan: "She's Not Jackie."
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist
organization) and that will be published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined
By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack
Obama, "You lie!" during the president's nationally televised speech on healthcare,
the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the conservative
grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came
from the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a
href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-joe-wilson-member-
neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire
to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who
must apologize, not the one who identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-
enactors who spent their organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields
and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was substantially <a
href=http ://www. sp lcenter. org/inte l/intelreport/artic le .j sp?pid=1027 >taken
over</a> by an organized cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154 >here</a> for
more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society
into what the veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st
century Christian war machine capable of uniting the Confederate community and
leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive
list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to "hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=hftp://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored
dreams</a> of creating a seemingly benign front group for a more sophisticated
version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically, but,
sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a
German neo-Nazi magazine in 1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the
advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the robes and
hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization.'" With the SCV,
Lyons discovered he didn't have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV,
the organization's political newsletter, <a href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/
>The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor), transformed
into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying
members of the SCV — presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went
defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing blacks as genetically
inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned
that if Obama runs for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature"
would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated
the blacks, in perhaps the mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions.
The blacks — then a childlike people — had been selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for
$.25 apiece in national elections."
--"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury,
September/October 2003
"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among
the races; but at Columbia, a liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that
there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the only biological differences between the
blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the media heaped
special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical
of the black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly
competent people who were being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be
extremely anti-white and would demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative
action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who were seeking jobs or admission to
College and Graduate Schools."
--"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern
Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial
riots. If he were running for re-election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature
that would seriously damage race relations in America, and leave entire sections of some of our
cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's
takeover by open white supremacists began. But he didn't. Or he could have
withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist rag.
But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired
campaign in 2000 to keep the Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state
capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very honorable,"
Wilson <a href=http ://news. bbc . co .uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at
the time, responding to critics of the Confederate flag.
Wilson's rebel yell at Obama has electrified the Republican grassroots, filling his
campaign coffers with donations <a
href=http://wwvv.freep.com/article/20090910/BLOG36/90910072/Wilson-takes-
case-online--pleads-for-donations>he is soliciting</a> from conservatives across
the country and earning the undistinguished, previously unknown backbencher
primetime appearances on right-wing talk shows. Wilson has become the new voice
of the Republican opposition, reigniting the Lost Cause as a raucous crusade to
sabotage healthcare reform.

Just following up on a few items.
First, see below on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Third, on QME, Gates and Barak are meeting the week of UNGA and we are holding until then if you are comfortable
with that.
Fourth, Declan Kelly is going to be in Belfast Monday and Tuesday with Lou Susman. I will be there Tuesday for all of the
official meetings. Declan and I will stay Tuesday night after Lou leaves and have dinner with a broad cross-section of
folks.
Fifth, I'm working with Holbrooke's and Lew's shops on the materials for Af/Pak, and we'll have a concept paper over
the weekend on the UNGA curtain raiser.
Sixth, Mike Fuchs and I met with Team WHA on Mexico, following up on Carlos' memo. Mike is working with WHA to
ensure that we create a productive agenda and outcomes for the Merida meeting you will participate in at UNGA.
(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of
our Embassies have been able to confirm local media reports.

Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom
The State Department suffers from low morale, bottlenecks, and bureaucratic ineptitude. Do we need to kill it to save it?
BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009
Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles
of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.
Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-
century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide
range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has
changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most
pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after
report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to
respond to the new 21st-century paradigm.
But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and
reassign the pieces?
There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its "core missions" of
traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found
that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a
bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,
the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including
"today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria," the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the
Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership
in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers
capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.
By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on
Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department
now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for
example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State
Department's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs.
Further, rivalries between the different "cones" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the "conal caste system"
-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau
noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a "failed office" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.
Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership "does not understand public diplomacy." The sentiment is
widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,
described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional
discrimination against those in the career track.
Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human
and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its
bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike
Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is
so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If
there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean
it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.
The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such
luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the "expanding
role of the military in U.S. foreign policy." He said he was concerned by the "migration of functions and authorities from
U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense."
Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy
it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public
diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --
could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.
But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.
The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the
U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.
Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one
hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This "Department of State
and Non-State" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and
upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid
hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.
Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow
authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries
and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to
oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the
regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.
Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would
help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense
Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regional
leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These
changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for
today's requirements.
But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a
bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growing
power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more
importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.
In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for the
State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight
years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed
cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and
implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The
United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president
whose entire election platform was built around the word "change," and an American public that would be outraged at
the dysfunction if it only knew the details.

I didn't - but hard to believe he did. I was pretty surprised myself when I read the piece.
Just shows you that it's near impossible to take issue with the job you're doing it, which is why the political reporters
have to resort to the manufactured drama of interactions with the WH.
Face was good. Perfect in that it generated no issues to clean up, but other networks picked up clips re Iran.
Gates's remark that he couldn't send any new troops before January to Afghanistan seems to be the only thing
approaching news.

Jake, Want to make sure you saw the front page story below. It's really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained at
Guantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U.S. a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most of
the world (although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. Toribiong re this was a good
move right after Alcy upset the Palauans (as you feared) in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately. Jeff
2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo
To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family
By Del Quentin Wilber
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, September 28, 2009
Bahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the
Pacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.
It should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the
surprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can
look after his older brother, a fellow detainee.
The brothers' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of
Guantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a
Jan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties
facing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the
United States.
The brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of
the United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United
States launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Since at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.
Five went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering
the possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most
countries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China.
In recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice
Department.
The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed
mental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his
attorney, Elizabeth Gilson.
To make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went
searching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.
"This is just very difficult and sad," said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006
who considers himself a friend of both brothers.
"Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother," Qasim said through an interpreter. "His brother is only there
because of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them."
Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan
Baker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.
The earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says.
Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to
comment or did not return phone messages.
In 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small
house in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were
not particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and
ensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar
sold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.
Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly
ran out of money and couldn't find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him
about a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted "to fight against the Chinese government."
"If I went," he told military officials, "I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan."
There, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group
built houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other
calisthenics, records show.
Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and
told Arkin to find his brother. "He left because he was a dutiful son," Gilson said.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar's camp,
sending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,
where they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.
Meanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned
over the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.
In 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the
time that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later
dissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.
Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter
working for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an
interrogation room.
When they saw each other, they hugged and wept. "It was just so emotional," Abbas said. "These brothers from
across the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time."
In 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been
disrespectful to the guards, records show.
Not for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was
granted a request to be moved to Arkin's camp. "I missed my brother so much," he told military officials.
By the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any
evidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a
judge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are
awaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.
Last year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games
and books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to
come. "I know I'll die in here," Arkin told Gilson not long ago. "In China, at least I would have a trial and
sentence."
Since taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar
by phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered
fruitless legal victories.
Two weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau's
generous offer. "Every day here is an eternity," he told Gilson through an interpreter. "But I have to look out for
my brother."

FW: Friday Presentation on Urgent Threat - Bill Burns will not be at the Retreat
 --- 

He indicated he will not be back until Friday night or Saturday am -- are you saying postpone the entire Retreat?
 --- 

Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.
The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.
I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.
I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.
Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.
Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.

new Iran-China oil deal, reported in Iran (in English) and in China (in Chinese)
B6B6
Secretary Clinton,
Just wanted to make sure that you saw the news about one of China's oil conglomerates and the Iranian National Oil
Company over the
weekend:
Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed
a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese
company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne,
Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers
a 90 percent stake in the project.
A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this
information in English at this time is worth considering.
The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources
with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though):

Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal
Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the
development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.
The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in
Lausanne, Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)
that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.
CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project
with NICO holding 20 percent, and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.
The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost
around $2.5 billion.
The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's
largest finds in the last 30 years.
Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.
The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after
development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.
China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran
over its peaceful nuclear program.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office
Phone: 202.224.6221
Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to "live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success." The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces "is our goal."
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops "is absolutely our Achilles heel."
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the "Sons of Iraq." They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution."
But this "game changing" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: "Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests."
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.
