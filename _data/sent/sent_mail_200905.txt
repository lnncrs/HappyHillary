Challenger withdraws from race to unseat Afghan president
KABUL (Reuters) — One of the top candidates expected to bid to unseat Afghan President Karzai withdrew abruptly from
the election race, dealing a blow to opposition hopes of fielding a contender with a broad enough base to win.
Gul Agha Sherzai, popular governor of Nangarhar Province and a former anti-Soviet guerrilla commander, had been in
talks to head up a broad opposition ticket with two vice presidential candidates that would span ethnic lines.
But he told a news conference that he had met Karzai and had been persuaded not to run.

Iran: US journalist's case will get fair review
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's foreign minister assured his visiting Japanese counterpart that the case of an American journalist
imprisoned in Tehran for allegedly spying for the United States will get a fair review on appeal. Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki said 32-year-old Roxana Saberi's appeal will be "reviewed justly and humanely." He spoke at a
joint news conference Saturday with Japan's Hirofumi Nakasone, who expressed concern over the case during his visit to
Iran. Saberi is a dual Iranian-American citizen who was born in Fargo, North Dakota. Her father is Iranian and her
mother is Japanese. She was arrested in January in Tehran and sentenced last month to eight years in prison after a one-
day trial behind closed doors. Her case has raised an international outcry

Yes, everything is being readjusted including the personnel meetings. Angolan FM -- yes, I can set that up. And yes,
invited to the Initiative for Global Development but after running the invitation by senior staff here and having a candid

Internet can help free US reporters in NKorea: Clinton
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
"We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable," Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is "a signal that there can be" a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are "baseless."
The North has previously said they would go on trial for "hostile acts" and illegally entering the country. Their trial would
be held "on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them," it has announced.
While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along
the narrow Tumen River which marks the border with China.
Internet can help free US reporters in NKorea: Clinton
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
"We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable," Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is "a signal that there can be" a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are "baseless."
The North has previously said they would go on trial for "hostile acts" and illegally entering the country. Their trial would

Ahem
Politico:
Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy
insurance coverage.
Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way
through tax penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and
Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance
Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for
those who already have coverage.
President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which
means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.
The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate
was the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would
purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.
Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million
people. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly
assailed Obama for his no-mandate position.
Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.

told me he's meeting with on Friday. He told me things you would in my judgment want

AMS did not like any of this both for the substance and because she did not write it so we did not share it with you
today. Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you.
Frame:
The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.
In advancing our shared security, we seek to:
• Reduce threat of violent extremism
• Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction
In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:
• Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
• Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
• Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights
• Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and
confront the spread of pandemic disease (e.g., AlDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and
integrating diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
• Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
• Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;
31
• Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
• Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of
variable geometry (Le., focused on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
• listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue
• being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are
similarly accountable;
• focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new
technology to create buy in from bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced
on the ground and sustainable;
• eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our
goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create
greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
• creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables
and benchmarks for each country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
• Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
• Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;
• Food and agriculture as the cornerstone of sustainable local economies
• Global health as the foundation for the future
Reform our government institutions
• Improve coordination in planning and budgeting across our diplomacy and
development
• Make Ambassadors country-level CEOs responsible for government-wide
efforts in each country.
o Grow the quality, talents and capacities of our development institutions;
o Introduce effective metrics and evaluation for accountability
Improve delivery and outcomes
32
• Assess and promote what works and stop spending resources on what doesn't.
• Establish transparent benchmarks for measuring success

Hillary: Spoke with Jonathan Powell. What we heard is accurate. More: Labour will suffer a large
defeat in the European elections on June 4. (New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffection
with all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)
Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the
next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and
motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign
Secretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why
doesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at
this point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top
tax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging
understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the
project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,
one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a
contemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony
bitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to
Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging
scheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's and
become Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's
job, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's
left-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony
sees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak with him soon. He is trying to become President of
Europe if and when Lisbon treaty passes. Jonathan made an interesting and ironic comment about
Colin Powell, given Tony's deference to him, that Powell's flaw was being too deferential to Bush.
From bitter experience, Jonathan is wishing you well, be close to the president, and advance your
ideas, too. There's more for when we can talk. Sid

As HRC requested for this weekend, attached is a draft base text for the big speech/FA article. I will be on a
plane all day Wednesday heading for Asia to do policy planning talks, so it would be great to have her feedback either by
phone on Monday or meeting with her on Tuesday — that way I could turn around another draft by Thursday to
response to her reactons and then Lissa and I could work on turning it into a real speech draft and circulate more
widely. I will also have plenty of time on my trip to work over a version that would be more suitable for Foreign Affairs,
assuming she is comfortable with the overall frame and the different pieces.
Have a good weekend!

By MATTHEW LEE
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon announce that gay American diplomats will be
given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday.
In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are "unfair and must end," as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
"Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad," she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
"It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers," she says.
"At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do," Clinton says.
Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports,
government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities
abroad.
In addition, gay diplomats' families will now be eligible for U.S. government emergency evacuations and training courses
at the Foreign Service Institute, the message says.
The announcement, expected this week, was provided to the AP by a State Department official who is a member of the
Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies organization. Two department officials not affiliated with the organization
confirmed its accuracy.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publically about the changes.

This evening was a lovely moment. And I'll long remember your line about
"Pretty Bunkers." Good luck in translating that into policy, or even practice. Anyway,
thanks. S.

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with
ssues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her
which I am involved as the I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

sure -- bottom line - you need a special security code to get on line from a computer outside the building. Only 1 in 5 of
our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access.
This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby
increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until
they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email.

Early Draft: International Energy Coordinator
2009-05-17 Position Description - International Energy Coordinator - Draft.doc
B6
Attached and below is a draft of the international energy coordinator position. I have been speaking with David
Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil
in the details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key
objectives in international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the
Secretary embraced in QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's
double-hatting in the past rather than a dedicated staffing).
Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early
afternoon. This is, as you will see, a bit of a high wire act as: B5
I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest
convenience -7 in text edits in caps most appreciated (preferred over general comments). We are pushing so that
by the Secretary's hearing on Weds, we can respond yes should he inquire if this position is in process.
thanks.

4 women were elected to be members of parliament for the first time. As you remember (because you were an eloquent
voice for them), women finally won the right to vote and stand for office in 2005, but failed to win seats in the two previous
election cycles.
You know some of the women who won, including Rola Dashti, who was one of the women who got the Vital Voices
award and had been part of the long-time struggle.
I told Lissa. You might want to mention in your Barnard speech.

Re: Brazil and Mexico
If we set the expectation now that the outcome is likely to not go our way, ANY alternative - even one kicking the can
down the road as Jake outlines below - would be seen as a significant victory.
And as an added bonus, it would be an opportunity to highlight your personal dedication to and prioritization of human
rights/democracy, which we've been criticized for since China.
 --- 


 --- 

Tom backgrounded them yesterday in the briefing room, not certain but don't think he put down any groundwork on
this specifically.
But in terms of setting expectations it would be a combo of a few overt and not overt things:
- Seeing what Admin/For Pol Members of Congress are on TV today and the shows tomorrow, all we need is one person
to float it.
- We have flight time tomorrow when Tom & Jake can do it on background or OTR.
- There's one blogger that folks loosely follow, I know how to get her something through a 3rd party.
- I have to talk to a few of our guys today like Matt Lee on misc stuff, and I'm sure he'll ask me something about the OAS
where I can easily say the folks in WHA are real pessimistic. And our travelers traffic info among themselves. The best
thing to put out there would be the notion that there are those who don't think you should go. If you don't, you don't.
But if you do, you chose to be direct, to make a principled stand.
Shouldn't be too tough, because the notion of Cuba being voted in is something they will WANT to believe, it'll make
good copy. And it makes it easier to explain any decision/outcome
 --- 

Tom's backgrounder definitely played down expectations.

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold, you might make the point that we have come a LONG way
on Cuba so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he's
taken, especially since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.
Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

Reached out tom about your calls this morning.
He reports that the Mexicans are appreciative for the call and are energized. They are reaching out to others to try to
find a helpful solution.
Amorim called the Brazilian Ambassador here, who tom spoke to after your call. Amorim was very happy with the call,
especially the detailed discussion of possible solutions. He professed a desire to work with you to resolve this issue.
Brazil recognizes that it is being tagged as the "blocker on democratic language and wants to get out of the way. That
explains Amorim's heavy push to give this issue back to Insulza. Torn told the Brazilian Ambassador that Insulza has a big
credibility problem in our Congress, and that we, Brazil, Mexico, and others cannot walk away from the issue. This was
being relayed back to Amorim.
Among a core group of countries there is a growing realization that lack of consensus could be very damaging for the
OAS and its members. Tom thinks your calls have injected new urgency into the search for a solution.
He will be sending a classified update on the latest in a few hours. We will pouch to the house.
